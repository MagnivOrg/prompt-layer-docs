**Agentic workflows** enable you to automate complex, multi-step tasks by chaining multiple prompts together. Below are the key steps to build and run an agent, with clear instructions for each stage.

## Import or Create Multiple Prompts

Assemble the prompts required for your workflow. You can import existing prompts or create new ones to form the building blocks of your agent.

**Step by Step:**

1. Open your prompt registry.
2. To add an existing prompt, select it from the list; or click the **Create Prompt** button to start a new one.
3. Verify that each prompt includes the necessary input variables and configuration.
4. Organize your prompts in a logical order for later chaining.

## Create an Agent That Runs Prompts Sequentially

Build an agent that executes a series of prompts one after the other. Sequential execution ensures that each prompt completes before the next begins, improving reliability and structure.

**Step by Step:**

1. In your agent creation interface, select the prompts you assembled.
2. Arrange the prompts in the desired sequence to reflect the logical workflow.
3. Confirm the order and save your agent configuration.
4. This sequence ensures that the output from one prompt can be used as input for the next, creating a smooth, automated process.

## Enter Input Variables and Run the Agent

Customize your agent by setting the necessary input variables. Once configured, running the agent will automatically process the chained prompts to deliver cohesive and dynamic results.

**Step by Step:**

1. Open the agent editor and locate the input variables section.
2. Enter or update the required input values for each prompt in the sequence.
3. Save your changes and execute the agent.
4. Review the output to ensure that the entire workflow is functioning as expected, and adjust the input values if needed.

This comprehensive approach allows you to build, test, and refine agentic workflows that automate complex tasks using multiple prompts.
