<Tip>
  This module requires a prompt to be used, so ensure you have one set up in
  your PromptLayer account before proceeding. Use the [Getting
  Started](/onboarding-guides/getting-started) guide to create a prompt.

**Agents** are AI systems that automate complex workflows by executing a sequence of prompts. Like a doctor gathering information for a diagnosis, agents chain prompts together, using one output as the next input. This reduces manual effort, maintains logical flow, and improves efficiency in AI-driven processes.

### Example Use Cases for Agents

Agents are ideal for:

- **Medical Diagnosis Assistants**: Gathering insights from multiple medical models and synthesizing the best possible answer.
- **Data Processing Pipelines**: Refining, filtering, or transforming data using multiple models in sequence.
- **Customer Support Automation**: Automating logical decision-making across different models or APIs to answer support queries dynamically.

By structuring agents in a modular way, AI systems can adapt dynamically based on real-time outputs. Learn more in our [Agents Documentation](/why-promptlayer/agents).

### Create Multiple Prompts

Gather the prompts required for your agent. Instead of duplicating content from the Getting Started guide, refer to the [Getting Started](/onboarding-guides/getting-started) guide for details on how to create prompts.

For the Doctor example, you might use:

- The "rephrase-question" prompt refines a question for better clarity.
- The "ai-doctor" prompt analyzes the user's symptoms and provides a diagnosis.
- The "choose-best-answer" prompt selects the best response from a list.

## Create an Agent That Runs Prompts Sequentially

Construct an agent to execute your chained prompts one after the other, ensuring smooth data flow between steps.

1. Navigate to **Registry → Agents**.
2. Click **Create Agent**.
3. Click **Add Node** and set Node Type to **Prompt Template**.
4. Select the previously created "rephrase-question" prompt.
5. Repeat for other prompts:
   - Use the "ai-doctor" prompt multiple times with different models.
   - To change the model, select "ai-doctor" and click the pencil icon next to the model engine.
6. Arrange prompts in order:
   - First, rephrase the question.
   - Next, query multiple models for diagnoses.
   - Then, combine results.
   - Finally, connect to the choose-best-answer prompt.
7. Confirm the sequence and **Save** the configuration.

## Enter Input Variables and Run the Agent

Customize your agent by specifying input variables for each prompt. Running the agent automates the workflow—processing each step in sequence to generate a complete, integrated output.

1. Open the agent editor and locate the input variables section **at the top left of the editor panel**.
2. Enter or update the required input values for each prompt (for example, the user’s symptoms and any additional diagnostic details).
3. Save your changes and **Run** the agent.
4. Review the output to ensure the entire workflow functions as expected, and adjust the input values if needed.

## Agent Tracing

Traces are a powerful feature in PromptLayer that allow you to monitor and analyze the execution flow of your applications, including LLM requests.

To see the traces for an agent:

1. Open the sidebar on the left and select Traces.
2. Click on the agent name to see the traces for the agent.
