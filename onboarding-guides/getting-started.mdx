To effectively use **PromptLayer**, you need a prompt as the foundation for most interactions. In this guide, we'll begin by **creating** a prompt, **testing** it in the Playground for real-time feedback, and then **reviewing** the logs to **analyze** its performance.

## Create or Import a Prompt

Begin by creating a new prompt or importing an existing one. This step centralizes your prompt templates for easy management and refinement.

**Step by Step:**

1. Navigate to the prompt registry.
2. Click the **Create Prompt** button
3. Fill in the required details such as the prompt name, messages, and input variables.
4. Save your prompt to add it to your registry.

## Run a Prompt in the Playground

Test your prompts in an interactive environment to see real-time responses and iterate quickly on your design.

**Step by Step:**

1. Open your prompt from the PromptLayer dashboard.
2. Click the **Playground** button.
3. (Optional) Add something new to the prompt if desired.
4. Execute the prompt by clicking the **Run** button or pressing "command + enter" on Mac (or "alt + enter" on Windows).
5. Observe the output in real time and adjust your prompt as needed.

## Review Prompt Logs

Analyze past prompt executions by reviewing detailed logs. Logs provide insight into prompt performance and help identify areas for improvement.

**Step by Step:**

1. Open the sidebar on the left (if not already open).
2. Click on **Requests** to access the log entries.
3. Use the available filters to locate the log for the specific prompt you want to review.
4. Click on a log entry to view detailed information, including execution time and output data.
5. Examine performance metrics.
   - Look at execution time, cost, token usage, and model parameter settings; optionally, assign a star rating or score, or share the log with your team to highlight top-performing requests.
6. Use these insights to refine and optimize your prompt.
