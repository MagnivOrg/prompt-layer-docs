To effectively use **PromptLayer**, you need a **prompt** that defines how your AI interacts with users. Creating a prompt allows you to set precise instructions for generating content, automating workflows, and ensuring consistent results.

### Understanding Prompts

A prompt is an **instruction given to an AI model** to guide its response. Well-structured prompts:

- Define **expected behavior** to control AI outputs.
- Use **precise input variables** to make responses predictable.
- Allow fine-tuning for **better accuracy and relevance**.

### Why Prompts Matter

A well-structured prompt defines AI behavior, ensuring accurate and relevant outputs. Creating a strong foundation with precise input variables enhances predictability and effectiveness.

## Create a Prompt

For example, an **ai-poet** prompt can instruct the AI to generate creative haikus based on a given topic, streamlining your creative process and making it easier to refine your output over time.

**Step by Step:**

1. Log in to your PromptLayer account.
2. Navigate to the **Prompt Registry**. ([Read more](/features/prompt-registry/overview))
3. Click the **Create Prompt** button to start a new prompt.
4. Fill in the required details such as the **Prompt Title**, **Messages**, and **Input Variables**.  
   Input Variables can be defined using **f-string** or **jinja2** syntax. ([Read more](/features/prompt-registry/overview#string-formats))
5. Select the **Model** and configure its **Parameters**.
6. Save your prompt by clicking on **Create Prompt**.

## Run a Prompt in the Playground

Testing your prompt in the **Playground** gives you immediate feedback on its performance. This interactive environment lets you see how the AI interprets your instructions and allows you to make adjustments to achieve better results.

**Step by Step:**

1. Open your prompt from the PromptLayer dashboard.
2. Click the **Playground** button.
3. (Optional) Modify the prompt if you want to test new changes.
4. Execute the prompt by clicking the **Run** button or pressing "command + enter" (Mac) or "alt + enter" (Windows).
5. Observe the output in real time and adjust your prompt as needed.

## Review Prompt Logs

Reviewing prompt logs helps you monitor performance metrics such as execution time, cost, token usage, and model parameters. These insights enable you to identify areas for improvement and optimize your prompt for better results.

**Step by Step:**

1. Open the sidebar on the left (if not already visible).
2. Click on **Requests** to access your log entries.
3. Use the available filters to locate the log for the specific prompt you want to review. ([Read more](/why-promptlayer/advanced-search))
4. Click on a log entry to view detailed information, such as execution time, cost, token usage, and model parameters.
5. Examine performance metrics (consider assigning a star rating or score) to identify top-performing requests.
6. Use these insights to refine and optimize your prompt.
