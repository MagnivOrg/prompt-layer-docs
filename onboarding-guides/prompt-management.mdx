<Tip>
  This module requires an existing prompt in your PromptLayer account. Please
  follow the [Getting Started](/onboarding-guides/getting-started) guide to
  create one if needed.
</Tip>

Effectively manage your prompts in PromptLayer by versioning them for tracking and retrieval, ensuring consistency across projects. This guide covers saving a new version and programmatically pulling the latest one.

## Save New Version

Save prompt updates as new versions to track changes, compare iterations, and revert if needed.

**Example Scenario:**

During **[Getting Started](/onboarding-guides/getting-started)**, we created a prompt called ai-poet, which generates a haiku on a given topic. Initially, it takes a single input variable for the topic:

- “You are a skilled poet specializing in haikus. Your task is to write a haiku based on a topic provided by the user.”

You decide to enhance it by allowing users to specify a language as well:

- Add a new input variable (e.g., `{language}`) so the haiku can be written in multiple languages.
- Update the system prompt to instruct the AI to consider both the topic and the language.

By saving these edits as a new version, you can:

- **Compare** how users respond to the updated prompt (e.g., do they enjoy the multilingual option?).
- **Measure** any improvements in user satisfaction or engagement.
- **Rollback** to the old version if changes don't yield the desired results.

**How to save a new version:**

1. Navigate to the **Prompt Registry**.
2. Select the existing prompt you want to update (e.g., "ai-poet").
3. Click the **Edit Version #** button to modify the prompt’s content (tone, instructions, or additional variables).
4. Make your changes, such as adding friendlier text or clarifying the product’s key features.
5. Click **Update Template** to save these edits as a new version.

     <source src="./videos/add-new-version.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
   </video>

By following these steps, you can keep a detailed history of your prompt’s evolution and quickly revert to an older version if necessary.

Saving a new version of your prompt lets you:

- **Label versions** for better organization (e.g., "beta", "stable", "prod"). ([Read more](/features/prompt-registry/release-labels))

  Labels make deploying new prompt versions easier by allowing dynamic references instead of fixed version numbers. With labels, you can:

  - Assign names like "beta", "stable", or "prod" to specific versions.
  - Ensure your application always uses the intended version.
  - Simplify rollbacks and updates for better workflow management.

- **Compare previous iterations** to track improvements.
- **Use A/B testing** to evaluate performance differences. ([Read more](/why-promptlayer/ab-releases))

## Retrieve Your Prompts from Code

Fetch the latest version of your prompt from code, ensuring consistent usage in production.

1. Obtain your **API Key** by going to **Settings** → **PromptLayer API Keys**.
   <img src="./images/api-keys.png" alt="API Keys" />
2. Initialize the PromptLayer client in your application.
3. Call the appropriate function to retrieve your prompt.
4. Use the retrieved prompt in your application logic.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from promptlayer import PromptLayer

pl_client = PromptLayer(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

template = pl_client.templates.get("your_prompt_name")
print(template)
```

```js Javascript
import { PromptLayer } from "promptlayer";

const promptLayerClient = new PromptLayer({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });
const template = await promptLayerClient.templates.get("your_prompt_name");
console.log(template);
```

</CodeGroup>

**Example:**

Imagine you're building an AI writing tool that generates content based on user input. By retrieving the prompt directly from your code, you can:

- Automatically use the latest version of the prompt.
- Reflect updates from PromptLayer without manual changes.
- Maintain consistency and reduce maintenance overhead.
