It's easy to organize and version your prompts inside of PromptLayer. This guide explains how to save a new version and retrieve the latest one programmatically.

<Tip>
  This module requires an existing prompt in your PromptLayer account. Please
  follow the [Getting Started](/onboarding-guides/getting-started) guide to
  create one if needed.
</Tip>

## Update an Existing Prompt

Every time you update a prompt in PromptLayer, a new version is created. You will always be able to track changes, compare versions, or revert if needed.

### Example

In the [Getting Started Onboarding](/onboarding-guides/getting-started), we created a prompt called “ai-poet” to generate a haiku on a given topic. Initially, it uses a single input variable for the topic:

```
SYSTEM:
You are a skilled poet specializing in haikus.
Your task is to write a haiku based on a topic provided by the user.
The haiku must have 17 syllables, structured in three lines of 5, 7, and 5.

USER:
{topic}
```

Next, we will update the prompt to allow users to specify a language.

1. First, add a new input variable `{language}`
2. Update the system prompt to instruct the AI to consider both the topic and the language.

### Instructions

1. Navigate to the **Prompt Registry**.
2. Select the existing prompt you want to update (e.g., "ai-poet").
3. Click the **Edit Version #1** button to open the prompt in an editor.
4. Make some changes
5. Click **Update Template** to save these edits as a new version.

   </video>

### Additional Features

- **Label** prompt versions for better organization (e.g., "prod" or "dev"). ([Learn more about release labels.](/features/prompt-registry/release-labels))
- Compare previous iterations to track improvements.
- Use **A/B testing** to evaluate performance differences. ([Learn more](/why-promptlayer/ab-releases))

## Retrieve Your Prompts from Code

To keep your PromptLayer prompts synchronized with your codebase, fetch the latest prompt version using the SDK.

1. Obtain an **API Key** by going to **Settings** → **PromptLayer API Keys**.
   <img src="./images/api-keys.png" alt="API Keys" />
2. Initialize the PromptLayer client in your application.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from promptlayer import PromptLayer

pl_client = PromptLayer(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

```js Javascript
import { PromptLayer } from "promptlayer";

const promptLayerClient = new PromptLayer({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });
```

</CodeGroup>

3. Retrieve the prompt and run it. This will pull the latest prompt version, run it client side, and log the results.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
response = pl_client.run(prompt_name="ai-poet")

print(response)
```

```js Javascript
const response = await promptLayerClient.run({
  promptName: "ai-poet", 
  inputVariables: input_variables,
});

console.log(response);
```

</CodeGroup>

Once you’ve set up the SDK and your codebase is properly synced with PromptLayer:

-	The latest or production version of your prompts will always synchronized.
-	New prompt versions can be deployed without requiring engineering code deploys.
