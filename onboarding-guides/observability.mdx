**Observability** enables you to monitor prompt performance and troubleshoot issues by reviewing detailed logs. Below are the key steps to enable logging and view logs—with clear instructions for each stage.

## Enable Logging

Set up logging and tracing within your SDK to capture detailed execution data. This enables you to monitor **latency**, track **errors**, and record **metadata** for each execution.

**Step by Step:**

1. Import the **required modules** and the **PromptLayer client**.
2. Configure **basic logging** to capture **informational messages**.
3. Initialize the **PromptLayer client** with your **API key**.
4. (Optional) Add any **additional logging configuration** as needed.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import logging
from promptlayer import PromptLayer

# Configure logging to display INFO level messages
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Initialize the PromptLayer client with your API key
pl_client = PromptLayer(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Additional logging configuration can be added here if needed.
```

```js Javascript
import { PromptLayer } from "promptlayer";

// Initialize the PromptLayer client with your API key
const promptLayerClient = new PromptLayer({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

// Log a confirmation message to indicate logging is enabled
console.log("Logging enabled for PromptLayer SDK.");
```

</CodeGroup>

## Run and View Log

After executing a prompt, review the logs to analyze performance and troubleshoot issues.

**Step by Step:**

1. Execute your prompt using the **SDK**.
2. Open the **sidebar** on the left (if it’s not already open).
3. Click on **Requests** to access your **log entries**.
4. Select a **log entry** to view detailed **information**, including **execution time**, **cost**, **token usage**, and **model parameters**.
5. Examine **performance metrics** and consider assigning a **rating** or **score** to highlight top-performing requests.
6. Use these insights to refine and optimize your **prompt**.

By following these steps, you can continuously monitor prompt performance and make **data-driven improvements**.
