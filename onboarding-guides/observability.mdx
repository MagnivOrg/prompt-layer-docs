To effectively monitor your prompts in **PromptLayer**, you can enable logging to capture detailed execution data, then review logs to pinpoint issues and optimize performance. In this guide, we explain how to set up logging and interpret log entries.

## Enable Logging

Capture execution details like latency, cost, and tokens to better understand prompt behavior.

**Step by Step:**

1. Configure logging in your application.
2. Initialize the PromptLayer client with logging enabled.
3. Run your prompt and observe the logs being generated.

```python Python
import logging
from promptlayer import PromptLayer

# Configure logging to display INFO level messages
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Initialize the PromptLayer client with your API key
pl_client = PromptLayer(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Additional logging configuration can be added here if needed.
```

```js Javascript
import { PromptLayer } from "promptlayer";

// Initialize the PromptLayer client with your API key
const promptLayerClient = new PromptLayer({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

// Log a confirmation message to indicate logging is enabled
console.log("Logging enabled for PromptLayer SDK.");
```

## Run and View Log

Review your logs to troubleshoot issues and gather performance metrics.

**Step by Step:**

1. Execute your prompt (via SDK or code).
2. Open the sidebar and click **Requests** to view log entries.

3. Use filters to locate the specific prompt log.
4. Click on the log entry to see execution time, cost, token usage, and more.
5. Assign a rating or score to highlight top-performing requests.
6. Use these insights to refine and optimize your prompt.
