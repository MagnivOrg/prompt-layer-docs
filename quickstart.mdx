To grasp some of the core features of PromptLayer, we'll build a Cake Recipe
generator that takes advantage of artificial intelligence to balance a chosen
type of cake and baking time.

Having the know-how to create a recipe for any type of cake, within a specific
amount of time, would be difficult without artificial intelligence. Wikipedia's
[List of Cakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cakes) is 330 cakes long
(we used an AI to count it for us), requiring a dedicated human spending years
to master recipes. To adjust a recipe to a set time, mastery over it is
necessary. Instead, artificial intelligence can adjust any recipe for us within
seconds.

## 1. Creating a Prompt

A prompt, in the context of artificial intelligence, is a carefully crafted
input provided to an AI model to elicit a specific response or output. It serves
as the primary means of communication between humans and AI systems, guiding
the model's behavior and shaping its generated content.

Learn more about [Prompts](https://www.promptlayer.com/glossary/prompt).

Prompts are the core of AI applications. PromptLayer is designed to help you
decouple this core from code.

Within the home of a workspace, a new Prompt can be created by clicking "New"
then selecting "Prompt."

<Frame>
    <img src="/new-quickstart-images/prompt-creation-access.png" alt="Prompt creation access in workspace" data-og-width="2880" width="2880" data-og-height="1624" height="1624" data-path="images/quickstart/prompt-creation-access.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3"  />
</Frame>

A new prompt has two default Roles for the model to exhibit: "System" and
"User."

<Accordion icon="circle-question-mark" title="System and User, Explained">
  ### "System"

  A System Prompt is a specialized type of Prompt used in AI language models that
  sets the overall context, behavior, or persona for the AI's responses. It acts
  as a foundational instruction set that guides the model's conduct throughout an
  interaction, often without being directly visible to the end-user.

  Learn more about [System Prompts](https://www.promptlayer.com/glossary/system-prompt).

  ### "User"

  User prompts are the specific instructions or questions a user provides to an AI
  system to elicit a desired response. These Prompts are dynamic and vary with
  each interaction, reflecting the user's immediate needs and goals. They can
  range from simple requests for information to complex instructions for
  generating creative content.

  Learn more about [User Prompts](https://blog.promptlayer.com/system-prompt-vs-user-prompt-a-comprehensive-guide-for-ai-prompts/#what-is-a-user-prompt).
</Accordion>

Let's begin building our Cake Recipe Generator. Create a new prompt, then
replace its contents with the following:

```markdown System wrap theme={null}
You are a world-class pastry chef and culinary instructor who specializes in making recipes clear, adaptable, and delicious. Your goal is to generate cake recipes that balance creativity and structure.

Recipes should always include:
1. A short description that captures the cake’s essence
2. A list of ingredients with precise measurements in both metric and US units
3. Step-by-step instructions written conversationally but clearly
4. Optional variations or substitutions

Keep instructions simple enough for home bakers, but detailed enough to ensure consistent results.
```

```markdown User wrap theme={null}
Create a cake recipe for {{cake_type}} that serves {{serving_size}} people and takes around {{baking_time}} minutes to bake.
```

You'll notice that the User prompt automatically styles the text surrounded by
double curly braces (e.g.: `{{cake_type}}`) separately from the rest of the
prompt's text. We have denoted, and PromptLayer is detecting, the usage of
templates. Within these curly braces, we are utilizing one of the basic building
blocks of engineering: variability. Roughly, variables are words that exist
abstractly within some software. As a result, the data associated to a variable
can be changed. In our case, the usage of variables suggest to PromptLayer that
when a prompt is ran, these words should be replaced by a value that the
prompt's run has provided. This will make more sense if we use these variables.

To use the variables we have defined within our prompt, PromptLayer's playground
provides the ability to create a groupings of values associated with variables
defined in a prompt. Under "Input Variable Sets" on the right hand side of the
editor, click "Define input variables."

A modal will appear with titled "Edit Input Variable Set," containing each of
the variables we have defined:

1. `baking_time`
2. `cake_type`
3. `serving_size`

Each variable has an associated "Click to edit," button, which allows us to
specify a value for that variable. Let's set each of the following values to be
utilized by PromptLayer when we run our prompt. Do not include the units for
values (i.e: "minutes" and "persons").

1. `baking_time` = 50 (minutes)
2. `cake_type` = Chocolate Cake
3. `serving_size` = 8 (persons)

By filling in these values in the secondary modal that appears when we "Click
to edit" a particular variable, we make them available to PromptLayer's
playground for usage when a prompt runs. After clicking "Done," we can "Run"
our prompt, and the Playground will automatically fill in these values for us,
resulting in a Cake Recipe for Chocolate Cake takes 50 minutes to bake, and
serves 8 persons.

Congratulations! You have engineered your first prompt!

These templates that we have denoted with double curly braces have more
features than variable input. It extends to encompass a range of engineering
concepts. They are a well-utilized format for adding templates to bodies of
text. This is the Jinja2 templating language.

Learn more about [Jinja2](/features/prompt-registry/template-variables#jinja2-templates).

<Frame caption="Curly Braces evoking Jinja2 templating, with `cake_type` and `serving_size` recognized as variables.">
    <img src="/new-quickstart-images/variables-explained.png" alt="Variables" data-og-width="5760" width="5760" data-og-height="3240" height="3240" data-path="images/quickstart/variables-explained.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3"  />
</Frame>

Now we can save the our prompt with a message like, "Added base version of Cake
Recipe Generator," by clicking "Save Template."

## 2. Improving with Versions

Versioning allows teams to safely refine and experiment without losing previous
work. Every version records what changed, when, and by whom, making it simple to
compare, test, or revert as your prompt evolves.

<Frame caption="Versions accumulated overtime to the left of a prompt.">
    <img src="/new-quickstart-images/prompt-versioning-display.png" alt="Prompt version history display" data-og-width="2880" width="2880" data-og-height="1624" height="1624" data-path="images/quickstart/prompt-versioning-display.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3"  />
</Frame>

Let's version our Cake Recipe Generator. Add these changes to the System and
User roles:

```markdown System wrap theme={null}
You are a Michelin-star pastry chef and recipe writer. Generate detailed, reliable, and imaginative cake recipes.

Each response must include the following sections formatted with clear headers:

**Overview**: A one-paragraph introduction capturing the cake’s story and mood.
**Ingredients**: Use bullet points with both metric and US measurements.
**Instructions**: Numbered steps with exact details (temperature, mixing times, resting periods).
**Optional Enhancements**: Variations, frostings, or pairings.

Maintain a confident yet friendly tone, suitable for both beginners and enthusiasts.
```

```markdown User wrap theme={null}
Generate a recipe for a {{cake_type}} that serves {{serving_size}} people and should be completed within {{baking_time}} minutes.
```

We have versioned our Cake Recipe Generator from being suitable for personal use
into a prompt that can be installed in an application, by improving its persona
sophistication and consistency.

Rather than have our AI adapt the role of "a world-class pastry chef and
culinary instructor," we instruct it to think along the lines of a "Michelin-star
pastry chef and recipe writer." Not only does this change refine the AI's
point-of-view, it also improves its specificity. Specificity is vital when
writing a prompt, as a particular choice of words can drastically change output.
Our first prompt is absent of our requirement for the AI to think along the
lines of a "recipe writer."

We further refine the prompt by explicitly defining "clear headers" for
different sections of the generated Cake Recipe.

```
**Overview**: ...
**Ingredients**: ...
**Instructions**: ...
**Optional Enhancements**: ...
```

This change allows us to be sure every prompt's response by our AI is organized
the same way. This also helps prevents the AI from failing to include a section.

You may have noticed the usage of double asterisk (e.g.: `**Overview**`) in our
prompt's new version, and how PromptLayer's editor bolds the text it surrounds
in the editor. This is provided by PromptLayer's integration of basic Markdown,
which is a type of formatting that can be introduced to a prompt using plain
text characters.

Beyond bold text, you can add:

```markdown Markdown Options theme={null}
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
*italicized* text
```

Try these out in the editor to view what their rendered results look like in
PromptLayer.

This versioned improvement over our first prompt further gains consistency by
explicating formatting for the AI's response. Rather than simply asking for a
"short description that captures the cake’s essence," we require "a
one-paragraph introduction capturing the cake’s story and mood," which clarifies
the length of output and focus for the subject of the description added to Cake
Recipes. The first version of the prompt's guideline: "step-by-step
instructions written conversationally but clearly" loses its vagueness with
"numbered steps with exact details (temperature, mixing times, resting
periods)."

### 2.a. Comparing Version's Differences

Inspired by version control tools, the Diff Viewer highlights deletions in red
and additions in green. This makes it easier to spot subtle edits that alter a
prompt’s behavior or output.

To clearly view the changes we made between the first version of prompt and the
second, ensure that you have the latest version selected (it should be
highlighted blue), then hover the previous version. This will reveal a "View
Diff" button. Click it view a side-by-side comparision of the two versions.

<Frame caption="The diff of two prompts, presented after clicking &#x22;View Diff&#x22;">
    <img src="/new-quickstart-images/prompt-diffing-display.png" alt="Prompt diffing comparison view" data-og-width="2880" width="2880" data-og-height="1624" height="1624" data-path="images/quickstart/prompt-diffing-display.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3"  />
</Frame>

### 2.b. Refining Automatically

The AI Prompt Writer helps you rewrite prompts in clear and natural language.
It suggests better ways to phrase your ideas, helping you get stronger results
without needing to understand how the AI works under the hood.

<Frame caption="The AI Prompt Writer, accessed by the Magic icon">
    <img src="/new-quickstart-images/prompt-ai-writer-display.png" alt="Prompt AI writer suggestions" data-og-width="2880" width="2880" data-og-height="1624" height="1624" data-path="images/quickstart/prompt-ai-writer-display.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3"  />
</Frame>

Here's an example prompt you can give to the AI Prompt Writer that can further
refine the Cake Recipe Generator we have built. Suggested changes  will vary
between each run of the AI Prompt Writer with this prompt.

```markdown Input for AI Prompt Writer  theme={null}
Update this prompt to consider allergies
```

Allergens are a complex consideration to handle. We can leverage AI to ensure we
completly address this, as it can be a leaned-upon as a source of exhaustive
thinking.

### 2.c. Switching AIs

PromptLayer keeps prompts independent of AI models. You can switch between
popular models like GPT-5, Opus, or Gemini directly from the dashboard.

<Frame
  caption="The Model Configuration Panel, accessed by clicking the current 
model at the bottom of the Editor."
>
    <img src="/new-quickstart-images/prompt-switch-model-display.png" alt="Switching models in the prompt editor" data-og-width="2878" width="2878" data-og-height="1622" height="1622" data-path="images/quickstart/prompt-switch-model-display.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3"  />
</Frame>

Switching the model of our Cake Recipe Generator allows us to test the
each of their responses, and determine which is the most suitable to addressing
the needs of our prompt's model. By default, your model may be using gpt-4o. A
switch to GPT-5.1 might improve consistency and creativity, but could be more
expensive.

We'll keep our model as gpt-4o for the rest of the Quickstart.

<Info>
  PromptLayer also supports [custom models](/features/custom-providers)
  and [fine-tuned models](/why-promptlayer/fine-tuning#fine-tuning)
  for teams that need specialized behavior.
</Info>

### 2.d. Exporting

Prompts can be exported to be utilized within other AI systems. Access it via
the settings button at the top of the prompt editor.

<Frame caption="&#x22;Copy to Clipboard,&#x22; accessible via settings">
    <img src="/new-quickstart-images/prompt-blueprint-display.png" alt="Prompt blueprint export view" data-og-width="2880" width="2880" data-og-height="1620" height="1620" data-path="images/quickstart/prompt-blueprint-display.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3"  />
</Frame>

This exported format of a prompt is known as its "Prompt Blueprint."

<Accordion title="Prompt Blueprints, Explained">
  Defined by PromptLayer, "Prompt Blueprints" format the information that build a
  Prompt (e.g.: the "User" and "System" roles) by surrounding its text.

  Excerpt from a Blueprint:

  ```
  ...
  "role": "system",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "### Bakery Chatbot System Prompt \n\n#### Persona & 
               Goal\nYou are a friendly, sweet, and helpful 
               assistant...",
      ...
    }
  ],
  ...
  ```

  Learn more about "[Prompt Blueprints](/running-requests/prompt-blueprints)"
  and its format.
</Accordion>

Copy and paste the Cake Recipe Generator's Prompt Blueprint into a word
processing application. It should look something like this:

```json  theme={null}
{
  ...
  "prompt_template": {
    "type": "chat",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": [
          {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "You are a Michelin-star pastry chef and recipe writer. Generate detailed, reliable, and imaginative cake recipes.\nEach response must include the following sections formatted with clear headers:\nOverview: A one-paragraph introduction capturing the cake’s story and mood.\nIngredients: Use bullet points with both metric and US measurements.\nInstructions: Numbered steps with exact details (temperature, mixing times, resting periods).\nOptional Enhancements: Variations, frostings, or pairings.\nMaintain a confident yet friendly tone, suitable for both beginners and enthusiasts.",
            "id": null,
            "annotations": null
          }
        ],
        "name": null,
        "tool_calls": [],
        "template_format": "jinja2"
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
          {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "Generate a recipe for a {{cake_type}} that serves {{serving_size}} people and should be completed within {{baking_time}} minutes.",
            "id": null,
            "annotations": null
          }
        ],
        ...
      }
    ],
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

### 2.e. Deploying with Labels

Release labels help you control which prompt versions are live. You can mark
some versions as “testing” and others as “production.” This makes it possible
to release changes slowly, compare results between two versions, and roll out
the best one when ready.

<Frame>
    <img src="/new-quickstart-images/prompt-release-access.png" alt="Accessing prompt release controls" data-og-width="2880" width="2880" data-og-height="1556" height="1556" data-path="images/quickstart/prompt-release-access.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3"  />
</Frame>

We can add a "testing" label to our prompt to mark that we are near-ready for
installing it in our application.

#### Comparing Versions' Results

A/B testing lets you compare two or more versions of a prompt to see which one
performs better. It’s a simple way to test small changes, like wording or tone,
before rolling them out to production.

PromptLayer makes A/B testing part of your workflow. You can assign release
labels such as “A” and “B” to different prompt versions, send each version a
portion of live traffic, and track which one produces better responses.

<Note>
  A/B testing prompts requires at least version of the prompt to have a set
  release label.
</Note>

This process helps teams learn what works through real data, not guesswork.
Once the winning version is identified, it can be promoted to production with
a single click.

<Frame>
    <img src="/new-quickstart-images/prompt-ab-test-display.png" alt="Starting a prompt A/B test" data-og-width="2880" width="2880" data-og-height="1560" height="1560" data-path="images/quickstart/prompt-ab-test-display.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3"  />
</Frame>

Learn more about [A/B testing](/ab-testing).

We can start an A/B test of our Cake Recipe Generator by hovering any version
of the prompt, then clicking "Start A/B Test." From here, we can select the
testing label. This will auto-populate another version of the prompt for the
labeled prompt to be tested against.

Try editing your A/B test to match the screenshot above.

<Accordion title="Duplcating the Screenshot Walkthrough">
  First, remove any incorrect versions by clicking the red "-" button. Then click
  "+ Add Version," select "Version 2" in the drop-down menu, and click "Add."
  This will duplicate the A/B test in the screenshot.
</Accordion>

## 3. Creating an Agent

"Agents" are software programs that perceive their environment, make
decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve a goal. These agents can
range from simple systems like a thermostat to complex digital assistants
that can execute multi-step tasks with minimal human intervention.

Unlike a Prompt, an Agent can independently plan and adapt its actions to
achieve an objective over an extended period.

Agents can be as simple as a single prompt or as advanced as a multi-step
workflow. You can build them visually by connecting steps together, with no
programming needed. Agents are useful for automating tasks or guiding the AI
through complex processes that unfold over several steps.

<Frame caption="An active A/B test with configured percentages">
    <img src="/new-quickstart-images/agent-creation-access.png" alt="Agent creation access in workspace" data-og-width="2880" width="2880" data-og-height="1624" height="1624" data-path="images/quickstart/agent-creation-access.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3"  />
</Frame>

## 4. Evaluating Performance

Evals are tests that show how well your prompts or agents perform. You can run
automated checks, collect feedback from people, or measure accuracy over time.
Evals make it easy to know when your AI is improving and when it needs work.

Learn more about [Evaluations](/features/evaluations/overview).

## 5. Analyzing Performance

Analytics help you understand how your prompts and agents are performing. They
show cost, speed, and quality, so you can make informed changes. Analytics also
create an audit trail for every run, helping teams track and review all work.

<Frame caption="Access Analytics for your workspace via the Analytics Navigation item in the Sidebar">
    <img src="/new-quickstart-images/analytics-display.png" alt="Analytics dashboard display" data-og-width="2880" width="2880" data-og-height="1552" height="1552" data-path="images/quickstart/analytics-display.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3"  />
</Frame>

### 5.a. Reviewing Prompt Executions

Within a workspace, Logs are viewable by clicking the "Live Logs" icon. Each
request to a model creates a Log.

<Frame caption="Access Live Logs for your workspace via the Live Logs Navigation item in the Sidebar">
    <img src="/new-quickstart-images/logs-display.png" alt="Logs interface display" data-og-width="2880" width="2880" data-og-height="1556" height="1556" data-path="images/quickstart/logs-display.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3"  />
</Frame>

Each prompt run is recorded with full details of what was sent and what came
back. Logs help teams trace errors, learn from past results, and improve
performance over time.

#### Drilling into a Prompt

When a prompt is selected, clicking the "Analytics & Logs" panel reveals the
Logs.

<Frame>
    <img src="/new-quickstart-images/logs-by-prompt-display.png" alt="Logs filtered by prompt" data-og-width="2880" width="2880" data-og-height="1556" height="1556" data-path="images/quickstart/logs-by-prompt-display.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3"  />
</Frame>

### 5.b. Reviewing Agent Executions

Tracing divides complex workflows into clear steps, called spans. You can see
exactly how long each step takes and where issues may occur, making problem
solving faster and easier.

<Frame caption="Access Traces for your workspace via the Live Logs Navigation item in the Sidebar, then select &#x22;Traces&#x22; at the top, next to requests">
    <img src="/new-quickstart-images/traces-display.png" alt="Trace visualization display" data-og-width="2880" width="2880" data-og-height="1556" height="1556" data-path="images/quickstart/traces-display.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3"  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Traces are for Agents, not Prompts
</Note>

### 5.c. Monitoring Behavior

Logs and traces together create observability, or the ability to see inside
your system. With PromptLayer, every part of your AI process becomes clear and
understandable, from first draft to production launch.

Learn more about [Observability](https://www.promptlayer.com/platform/observability).
