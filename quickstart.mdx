Get started using PromptLayer in minutes with our intuitive dashboard features designed to simplify prompt management and experimentation.

## Key Features
- **Create Prompts**: Build and edit prompts visually using the PromptLayer dashboard
- **Version Control**: Create new versions of prompts and manage them seamlessly
- **Release Labels**: Organize your production and staging environments
- **Compare Versions**: Use our diff tool to compare different versions of a prompt
- **Playground**: Experiment with prompts directly in the dashboard
- **View Logs**: Access detailed logs of all prompt interactions
- **A/B Testing**: Test multiple prompt versions side-by-side
- **Simple Workflows**: Create and execute straightforward workflows

First, make sure you have signed up for an account at [promptlayer.com](https://www.promptlayer.com) to begin üç∞

## Creating a Prompt

1. Navigate to the prompt registry from PromptLayer's home screen
2. Click "Create Prompt" and provide a name and description
3. Give your template a title in the 'Title' field
4. In the "SYSTEM" field, paste your system message
5. Add a new message with input variables using curly braces, like `{variable_name}`
6. Choose a model by clicking "Parameters"
7. Save the prompt template

<Tip>
  Input variables in curly braces will be filled out by user input when interacting with the AI.
</Tip>

## Creating New Prompt Versions

If you're working directly in the PromptLayer web interface, creating and managing versions is easy:

1. **Open the Prompt Registry**: Locate your existing prompt in the Prompt Registry to start editing
2. **Make and Save Changes**: Adjust the prompt's content, parameters, or input variables. Each save automatically creates a new version

For branching or reusing your work, take advantage of the "Duplicate" or "Copy a Version" features to:
- Duplicate a prompt into a different workspace
- Create an entirely new prompt template from an existing version

<Tip>
  Every save results in a new version, ensuring you always have a clear history of how your prompts evolve over time.
</Tip>

## Using Release Labels

To create and manage release labels for your prompt templates:

1. **Open the Prompt Registry**
   - Navigate to the Prompt Registry from the home screen
   - Locate the prompt template you want to label
2. **Add a Label**
   - Hover over the specific version of the prompt
   - Click "Add Release Label"
3. **Name Your Label**
   - Enter a unique label name (e.g., "prod", "staging", or "v2")
   - Remember: labels must be unique within the same prompt template

### Why Use Release Labels?

- **Selective Deployment**: Release different versions to specific user groups, minimizing risk
- **Gradual Rollouts**: Incrementally introduce updates to gauge performance
- **Targeted Testing**: Use labels like "staging" for internal testing
- **User Segmentation**: Direct specific segments (beta testers, employees) to particular versions

<Tip>
  By leveraging release labels, you gain fine-grained control over your prompt versions, making it easier to manage complex workflows and ensure a smoother deployment process.
</Tip>

## Experimenting in the Playground

The Playground enables prompt testing and refinement:

### Key Features
- Test prompts with different inputs
- Visualize outputs instantly
- Adjust parameters (temperature, max tokens)
- Fine-tune prompts before deployment

### Using the Playground
1. Retrieve the prompt template
2. Fill in any input variables
3. Send it to the chosen language model

## Analyzing Logs

Every interaction with your prompts is logged and accessible:

### Access Methods
- **Logs Tab**: View input, output, and model metadata
- **Run History**: Track history in the Playground sidebar
- **Playground**: Replay and debug old requests
- **Analytics**: Monitor performance and usage patterns
- **Versioning**: Track changes over time

<Tip>
  Use logs to debug, analyze performance, or build datasets for evaluations.
</Tip>

## A/B Testing

Our visual A/B testing feature helps optimize prompts through comparison:

### Dashboard Setup
1. Navigate to the A/B Releases Registry
2. Create a new A/B Release
3. Select the release label to overload (e.g., "prod")
4. Choose base prompt version and test versions

### Production Testing
Set up Dynamic Release Labels to:
1. Create multiple versions in the Prompt Registry
2. Configure traffic splitting based on percentages or segments
3. Route requests dynamically using release labels

## Simple Workflows

Build and manage AI agents using our visual workflow tools:

1. Access the drag-and-drop interface
2. Design your workflow steps
3. Configure components
4. Test and refine
5. Deploy without infrastructure management
