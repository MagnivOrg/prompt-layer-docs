        ### System
        A system prompt is a specialized type of prompt used in AI language models that 
        sets the overall context, behavior, or persona for the AI's responses. It acts 
        as a foundational instruction set that guides the model's conduct throughout an 
        interaction, often without being directly visible to the end-user.

        ### User
        User prompts are the specific instructions or questions a user provides to an AI 
        system to elicit a desired response. These prompts are dynamic and vary with 
        each interaction, reflecting the user's immediate needs and goals. They can 
        range from simple requests for information to complex instructions for 
        generating creative content.
