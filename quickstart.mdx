## Prompts
### Creation
Within the home of a workspace, a new Prompt can be created by clicking "New" 
then selecting "Prompt."

{/* TODO: image, showing selected prompt "New" button */}

This presents two Prompts, with default Roles for the model to exhibit: 
"System" and "User."

{/* TODO: image, showing new prompt panel w/ System and User */}

<Accordion
    icon="circle-question-mark"
    title='"User" and "System" Explained'
>
### "System"
A System Prompt is a specialized type of Prompt used in AI language models that 
sets the overall context, behavior, or persona for the AI's responses. It acts 
as a foundational instruction set that guides the model's conduct throughout an 
interaction, often without being directly visible to the end-user.

Learn more about [System Prompts](https://www.promptlayer.com/glossary/system-prompt).

### "User"
User prompts are the specific instructions or questions a user provides to an AI 
system to elicit a desired response. These Prompts are dynamic and vary with 
each interaction, reflecting the user's immediate needs and goals. They can 
range from simple requests for information to complex instructions for 
generating creative content.

</Accordion>
{/* TODO: gif, showing filled in text */}

### Versioning
Each new saved edit of a Prompt creates a version.

{/* TODO: gif of saving a new edit */}

<Accordion
    icon="circle-question-mark"
    title='"Versioning" Explained'
>
“Versioning” is a structured practice in software engineering that tracks and 
manages the evolution of a system, document, or piece of code over time. It 
assigns identifiers, often numerical or semantic, to distinguish one iteration 
from another, allowing developers to compare, revert, and understand changes 
across the project’s history. 

**When applied to Prompt Engineering, versioning maintains a clear record of how 
Prompts change across experiments and refinements.** Each iteration is preserved 
with its own identifier, allowing engineers to trace improvements in phrasing or 
logic, revert to earlier configurations, and ensure that only the most effective 
Prompt versions are deployed to users.
</Accordion>

#### Diffing
Two versions of a Prompt can be diffed by selecting a version, then hovering 
another. This will reveal the clickable "View Diff" button.

{/* TODO: gif of viewing a diff between two versions */}

<Accordion
    icon="circle-question-mark"
    title='"Diffing" Explained'
>
"Diffing" is a common software engineering mechanic that is employed to 
compare two verisons of some text. It isolates and visualizes the specific 
additions, deletions, and modifications made, providing granular detail on 
what has changed.

**When applied to Prompt Engineering, diffing helps identify precisely what 
modifications in a Prompt led to a different or improved AI output.**
</Accordion>

#### AI Prompt Writer
New versions of a Prompt can be generated with AI within the Editor.

#### Switch Models
A Prompt's model can be changed.

#### Prompt Blueprint
Prompts can be exported to be utilized within other applications like ChatGPT, 
Anthropic, etc. with its "Prompt Blueprint." 

{/* TODO: gif, demonstrating export with not-undefined data */}

<Accordion
    icon="info"
    title='"Prompt Blueprints" are a PromptLayer format'
>
Defined by PromptLayer, "Prompt Blueprints" format the information
that build a Prompt (e.g.: the "User" and "System" roles) by surrounding 
its text.

Excerpt from a Blueprint:
```
...
"role": "system",
"content": [
  {
    "type": "text",
    "text": "### Bakery Chatbot System Prompt \n\n#### Persona & 
             Goal\nYou are a friendly, sweet, and helpful 
             assistant...",
    ...
  }
],
...
```

### Releases
Under the date is the button clickable for creating a new release label.

<Accordion
    icon="circle-question-mark"
    title='"Release Labeling" Explained'
>
"Releases Labeling" is a process in software engineering that provides 
a structured approach to building, testing, and deploying new versions of 
software. It supports the engineering process to ensure that software is 
stable, meets quality standards, and is delivered to users efficiently.

**When applied to Prompt Engineering, release labels can guide the 
development process of Prompts to their final stage.** Labels like 
"testing," "under evaluation," or "finalized" provide clarity as Prompts 
are versioned. Labeling ensures that the correct version is being tested
or provided to users.
</Accordion>

#### A/B Testing
Hovering a Prompt version reveals the "Start A/B Test" button.

{/* TODO: image, A/B test */}

<Accordion
    icon="circle-question-mark"
    title='"A/B Testing" Explained'
>
"A/B Testing" is a method for data-driven decision-making in digital 
marketing, product design, and other fields. It identifies which of two 
verions of a item being tested perform better by comparing measured 
user responses to both.

**When applied to Prompt Engineering, A/B testing can uncover subtle user
behavior patterns.** It can validate assumptions about phrasing or structure
and build a data-backed history of what language works best across different
contexts or models.
</Accordion>

## Agents
Within the home of a workspace, a new agent can be created by clicking "New" 
then selecting "Agent."

<Accordion
    icon="circle-question-mark"
    title='"Agents" Explained'
>
"Agents" are software programs that perceive their environment, make 
decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve a goal. These agents can
range from simple systems like a thermostat to complex digital assistants 
that can execute multi-step tasks with minimal human intervention. 

Unlike a Prompt, an Agent can independently plan and adapt its actions to
achieve an objective over an extended period.
</Accordion>

## Evals
Evaluations can be added for both Prompts and Agents.

<Accordion
    icon="circle-question-mark"
    title='"Evaluations" Explained'
>
"Evaluations" are systematic quality checks for AI systems, used to measure 
and improve their performance, accuracy, reliability, and safety. They are a
set of structured processes and data used to test how well an AI performs a 
specific task and to identify areas for improvement, ensuring the AI works 
as intended and meets business goals.

## Analytics
Within a workspace, Analytics are viewable by clicking the "Analytics" icon.

{/* TODO: gif, image of the Analtics icon */}

<Accordion
    icon="circle-question-mark"
    title='"Analytics" Explained'
>
"Analytics" describes a methodology used in software engineering to improve
software quality and engineering processes. It uses human interpretation of 
data, purposefully created by the software for humans to improve it.

Many website developers use analytics to re-order elements on a page to ensure 
vistors become customers, negating the visitors' confusion in purchase 
decision-making. Websites are built with the ability to determine which 
elements are viewed, or engaged with, allowing for optimization of thier 
ordering or design.

**When applied to Prompt Engineering, analytics can enhance how Prompts are
designed, tested, and maintained.** Careful consideration of analytics can 
identify what language patterns drive stronger responses and reduce costs.

Learn more about "[Analytics](https://docs.promptlayer.com/why-promptlayer/analytics#analytics)."
</Accordion>

### Logs
Within a workspace, Logs are viewable by clicking the "Live Logs" icon. Each
request to a model creates a Log.

<Accordion
    icon="circle-question-mark"
    title='"Logs" Explained'
>
"Logs" are the composite data provided by the installation of Analytics code
into some software. 

**In the context of Prompt Engineering, this reference remains the same, but
are of a Prompt, rather than an application.** 
</Accordion>

{/*
#### View Logs By Prompt 
When a prompt is selected, clicking the "Analytics & Logs" panel reveals the
Logs.
*/}

### Tracing
Within a workspace, Traces are viewable by clicking the "Live Logs" icon, then 
navigating to "Trace" at the top of the logs. Selecting a Trace will reveal
its Spans.

{/* TODO: confirm/deny, the above tracing is only for Agents, thus add 
Agents heading */}
{/* TODO: Leave out the word "Span" in the above, and just explain it in the 
toggle, so spans can be black boxed */}

<Accordion
    icon="circle-question-mark"
    title='"Tracing" and "Spans" Explained'
>
Tracing is a process in software engineering written to code, tracking any 
action within some software end-to-end through the system. Spans are the 
individual actions that make up a trace. Software engineers write code in 
software that specifically emit Spans to build a Trace.

**When applied to Prompt Engineering, tracing and spans visualize the reasoning
chain that form final outputs, revealing how specific components contribute to 
them.** 
</Accordion> 

### Observability
Logs and Traces are updated in real time, enabling Observability.

<Accordion
    icon="circle-question-mark"
    title='"Observability" Explained'
>
"Observability" is a sub-practice of software engineering, where engineers
understand a system's internal state by analyzing the external data it 
generates, such as logs, metrics, and traces.

**When applied to Prompt Engineering, obervability is the basis for inferring
how to refine a Prompt and diagnose subtle issues.**
