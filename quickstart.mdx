### "System"
A System Prompt is a specialized type of Prompt used in AI language models that 
sets the overall context, behavior, or persona for the AI's responses. It acts 
as a foundational instruction set that guides the model's conduct throughout an 
interaction, often without being directly visible to the end-user.

Learn more about [System Prompts](https://www.promptlayer.com/glossary/system-prompt).

### "User"
User prompts are the specific instructions or questions a user provides to an AI 
system to elicit a desired response. These Prompts are dynamic and vary with 
each interaction, reflecting the user's immediate needs and goals. They can 
range from simple requests for information to complex instructions for 
generating creative content.

    title='"Versioning" Explained'
>
“Versioning” is a structured practice in software engineering that tracks and 
manages the evolution of a system, document, or piece of code over time. It 
assigns identifiers, often numerical or semantic, to distinguish one iteration 
from another, allowing developers to compare, revert, and understand changes 
across the project’s history. 

**When applied to Prompt Engineering, versioning maintains a clear record of how 
Prompts change across experiments and refinements.** Each iteration is preserved 
with its own identifier, allowing engineers to trace improvements in phrasing or 
logic, revert to earlier configurations, and ensure that only the most effective 
Prompt versions are deployed to users.
