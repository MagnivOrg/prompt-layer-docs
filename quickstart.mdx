## Prompts
### Creation
Within the home of a workspace, a new Prompt can be created by clicking "New" 
then selecting "Prompt."

{/* TODO: image, showing selected prompt "New" button */}

This presents two Prompts, with default Roles for the model to exhibit: 
"System" and "User."

{/* TODO: image, showing new prompt panel w/ System and User */}

    >
        ### System
        A System Prompt is a specialized type of Prompt used in AI language models that 
        sets the overall context, behavior, or persona for the AI's responses. It acts 
        as a foundational instruction set that guides the model's conduct throughout an 
        interaction, often without being directly visible to the end-user.

        ### User
        User prompts are the specific instructions or questions a user provides to an AI 
        system to elicit a desired response. These Prompts are dynamic and vary with 
        each interaction, reflecting the user's immediate needs and goals. They can 
        range from simple requests for information to complex instructions for 
        generating creative content.

### Versioning
Each new saved edit of a Prompt creates a version.

#### Diffing
Two versions of a Prompt can be diffed by selecting a version, then hovering 
another. This will reveal the clickable "View Diff" button.

{/* TODO: gif of viewing a diff between two versions */}

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion
    title='"Diffing" Explained'
    >
    "Diffing" is a common software engineering mechanic that is employed to 
    compare two verisons of some text. It isolates and visualizes the specific 
    additions, deletions, and modifications made, providing granular detail on 
    what has changed.

    **When applied to Prompt Engineering, diffing helps identify precisely what 
    modifications in a Prompt led to a different or improved AI output.**

#### AI Prompt Writer
New versions of a Prompt can be generated with AI within the Editor.

#### Switch Models
A Prompt's model can be changed.

#### Prompt Blueprint
Prompts can be exported to be utilized within other applications like ChatGPT, 
Anthropic, etc. with its "Prompt Blueprint." 

{/* TODO: gif, demonstrating export with not-undefined data */}

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion
    title='"Prompt Blueprints" are a PromptLayer format'
    >
    Defined by PromptLayer, "Prompt Blueprints" format the information
    that build a Prompt (e.g.: the "User" and "System" roles) by surrounding 
    its text.

    Excerpt from a Blueprint:
    ```
    ...
    "role": "system",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "### Bakery Chatbot System Prompt \n\n#### Persona & 
                 Goal\nYou are a friendly, sweet, and helpful 
                 assistant...",
        ...
      }
    ],
    ...
    ```

### Releases
Under date is the button clickable for creating a new release label.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion
    title='"Agent" Explained'
    >
    "Releases Labeling" is a process in software engineering that provides 
    a structured approach to building, testing, and deploying new versions of 
    software. It supports the engineering process to ensure that software is 
    stable, meets quality standards, and is delivered to users efficiently.

    **When applied to Prompt Engineering, release labels can guide the 
    development process of Prompts to their final stage.** Labels like 
    "testing," "under evaluation," or "finalized" provide clarity as Prompts 
    are versioned. Labeling ensures that the correct version is being tested
    or provided to users.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### A/B Testing
Hovering a Prompt version reveals the "Start A/B Test" button.

{ TODO: image, A/B test }

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion
    title='"A/B Testing" Explained'
    >
    A/B Testing is a method for data-driven decision-making in digital 
    marketing, product design, and other fields. It identifies which of two 
    verions of a item being tested perform better by comparing measured 
    user responses to both.

    **When applied to Prompt Engineering, A/B testing can uncover subtle user
    behavior patterns.** It can validate assumptions about phrasing or structure
    and build a data-backed history of what language works best across different
    contexts or models.
