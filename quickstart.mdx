PromptLayer is the prompt management platform for teams building AI applications. It gives you version control for prompts, observability into every request, and tools to evaluate and improve your AI over time.

This tutorial walks you through creating an AI application that generates cake recipes. You'll learn how to create prompts, track versions, and deploy to production.

## Creating Your First Prompt

Prompts are the core of any AI application. By managing them in PromptLayer instead of hardcoding them, you can edit prompts without deploying code, track every change, and test new versions safely.

From the PromptLayer dashboard, click **New** → **Prompt**.

<Frame>
  <img src="/new-quickstart-images/prompt-creation-access.png" alt="Creating a new prompt" />
</Frame>

A prompt starts with two messages. The **System** message sets the AI's behavior. The **User** message is what gets sent each time you run it.

<Accordion title="System and User Messages">
  **System message**: Defines the AI's persona, tone, and rules. Think of it as the "instruction manual" that stays constant across all runs. Use it for things like:
  - Setting a persona ("You are a helpful assistant...")
  - Defining output format ("Always respond in JSON...")
  - Establishing guardrails ("Never discuss competitors...")

  **User message**: The input that changes each time the prompt runs. This is where you put the actual request and any input variables. In production, your code will dynamically fill in this message.

  Some prompts also use **Assistant** messages to show example responses, which helps the AI understand the expected format.
</Accordion>

Replace the default content with:

```markdown System
You are a Michelin-star pastry chef. Generate cake recipes with:

**Overview**: One paragraph about the cake
**Ingredients**: Bullet points with metric and US measurements  
**Instructions**: Numbered steps with temperatures and timing
**Variations**: Optional frostings or substitutions
```

```markdown User
Create a recipe for {{cake_type}} that serves {{serving_size}} people.
```

Notice `{{cake_type}}` and `{{serving_size}}`. These are [input variables](/features/prompt-registry/template-variables)—think of them like mad-libs. When you run the prompt, you'll fill these in with real values.

  <img src="/new-quickstart-images/variables-explained.png" alt="Input variables in prompt" />
</Frame>

### Running Your Prompt

To test your prompt:
1. Click **Define input variables** in the right panel
2. Set `cake_type` to "Chocolate Cake" and `serving_size` to "8"
3. Click **Run**

Save your prompt by clicking **Save Template**.

<Accordion title="Prompt Writing Tips">
  - Use headers to structure your prompt (`**Section**:`)
  - Be specific about output format
  - Include examples when possible
  
  PromptLayer supports [Jinja2 templates](/features/prompt-registry/template-variables#jinja2-templates) for more advanced variable logic.
</Accordion>

## Versioning Your Prompt

PromptLayer tracks every change you make to a prompt. Each save creates a new version with a record of what changed, when, and by whom. Your version history appears in the left panel.

<Frame>
  <img src="/new-quickstart-images/prompt-versioning-display.png" alt="Version history" />
</Frame>

### Editing Prompts

To edit a prompt, make changes in the [Playground](/why-promptlayer/playground) and save. You can edit any message, add new messages, or change model settings.

Let's try it. Add this line to the end of your System message:

```
Always include a "Baker's Tip" at the end with advice for beginners.
```

Click **Save Template**. Before saving, PromptLayer shows you a diff of exactly what changed—deletions in red, additions in green. Add a commit message like "Added baker's tip requirement" and save.

<Frame>
  <img src="/new-quickstart-images/prompt-diffing-display.png" alt="Comparing versions" />
</Frame>

You can click any previous version to view it, or hover and click **View Diff** to compare any two versions side by side.

### Writing Prompts with AI

Click the magic wand icon to open the AI prompt writer. It can help rewrite or improve your prompts based on your instructions. Try asking it to "add allergy warnings" to the recipe generator.

<Frame>
  <img src="/new-quickstart-images/prompt-ai-writer-display.png" alt="AI prompt writer" />
</Frame>

### Switching AI Models

PromptLayer is model-agnostic. You can switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and [other providers](/features/supported-providers) without changing your prompt. Click the model name at the bottom of the editor to switch.

<Frame>
  <img src="/new-quickstart-images/prompt-switch-model-display.png" alt="Switching models" />
</Frame>

All prompts work across models, including [function calling and tool use](/features/prompt-registry/tool-calling). PromptLayer also supports [custom models](/features/custom-providers) and [fine-tuned models](/why-promptlayer/fine-tuning).

## Deploying to Prod

Once your prompt is ready, you can deploy it to production using release labels.

### Release Labels

[Release labels](/features/prompt-registry/release-labels) control which prompt version is live. You can mark versions as "production", "staging", or "testing". Your code fetches the prompt by label, so you can update the live version without changing any code.

<Frame>
  <img src="/new-quickstart-images/prompt-release-access.png" alt="Release labels" />
</Frame>

### A/B Testing

To compare prompt versions in production, assign different labels to different versions and split traffic between them. This lets you test changes on real users before fully rolling out.

<Frame>
  <img src="/new-quickstart-images/prompt-ab-test-display.png" alt="A/B testing prompts" />
</Frame>

## Building Agents

[Agents](/why-promptlayer/agents) are multi-step AI workflows. Unlike a single prompt, an agent can chain multiple prompts together, use tools, and make decisions based on intermediate results.

<Frame>
  <img src="/new-quickstart-images/agent-creation-access.png" alt="Creating an agent" />
</Frame>

Create an agent by clicking **New** → **Agent**. You can build workflows visually without writing code.

## Evaluations

Evals test how well your prompts perform. You can run automated checks, collect human feedback, or measure accuracy over time.

Learn more about [Evaluations](/features/evaluations/overview).

## Logs and Analytics

Every prompt run is logged with full request and response details. [Analytics](/why-promptlayer/analytics) show cost, latency, and usage patterns across your prompts.

<Frame>
  <img src="/new-quickstart-images/analytics-display.png" alt="Analytics dashboard" />
</Frame>

### Viewing Logs

Click **Logs** in the sidebar to see all requests. You can filter by prompt, [search by content](/why-promptlayer/advanced-search), and debug errors.

<Frame>
  <img src="/new-quickstart-images/logs-display.png" alt="Request logs" />
</Frame>

You can also view logs for a specific prompt by clicking **Analytics & Logs** in the prompt editor.

<Frame>
  <img src="/new-quickstart-images/logs-by-prompt-display.png" alt="Logs filtered by prompt" />
</Frame>

Use the **Backtest** feature to run a new prompt version against historical inputs and compare results.

### Traces and Spans

For agents, [traces](/running-requests/traces) show each step of the workflow as spans. You can see timing, inputs, and outputs for every step.

<Frame>
  <img src="/new-quickstart-images/traces-display.png" alt="Trace visualization" />
