## LiteLLM

[LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) allows you to call any LLM API all using the OpenAI format. This is the easiest way to swap in and out new models and see which one works best for your prompts. Works with models such as Anthropic, HuggingFace, Cohere, PaLM, Replicate, Azure.
