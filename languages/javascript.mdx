<Warning>
  Javascript support is experimental and will not be updated as frequently as
  the Python one. Follow [@promptlayer](https://twitter.com/promptlayer) for
  updates and check back here for Javascript requirements.
</Warning>

To get started, create an account by clicking ‚Äú_Log in_‚Äù on [PromptLayer](https://promptlayer.com/). Once logged in, click the button to create an API key and save this in a secure location ([Guide to Using Env Vars](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-read-environment-variables-from-nodejs/)).

Once you have that all set up, install PromptLayer using `npm`.

```bash
npm install promptlayer
```

## OpenAI

In the JavaScript file where the OpenAI APIs are integrated, include the following lines. They enable PromptLayer to track your requests without additional code modifications.

```js
import promptlayer from "promptlayer";

const OpenAI = promptlayer.OpenAI;
const openai = new OpenAI();
```

**You can then use `openai` as you would if you had imported it directly.**

<Info>
  Your OpenAI API Key is **never** sent to our servers. All OpenAI requests are
  made locally from your machine, PromptLayer just logs the request.
</Info>

### Adding PromptLayer tags: `pl_tags`

PromptLayer allows you to add tags through the `pl_tags` argument. This allows you to track and group requests in the dashboard.

**Tags are not required but we recommend them!**

```js
openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Say this is a test" }],
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  pl_tags: ["test"],
});
```

### Returning request id: `return_pl_id`

PromptLayer provides an option to retrieve the request id using the `return_pl_id` argument. When set to true, it returns a tuple where the second element is the request id.

```js
openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Say this is a test" }],
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  return_pl_id: true,
});
```

### TypeScript

The PromptLayer JavaScript library also supports TypeScript. You can type cast the `OpenAI` class to `typeof BaseOpenAI` to get the correct typings.

```ts
import BaseOpenAI from "openai";
import promptlayer from "promptlayer";

const OpenAI: typeof BaseOpenAI = promptlayer.OpenAI;

const openai = new OpenAI();
```

You can also use our custom attributes `pl_tags` and `return_pl_id` with TypeScript. You will need to add the `@ts-ignore` comment to ignore the TypeScript error.

```ts
openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Say this is a test" }],
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  // @ts-ignore
  return_pl_id: true,
});
```

This is because the `pl_tags` and `return_pl_id` arguments are not part of the OpenAI API.
