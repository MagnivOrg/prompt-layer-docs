<Warning> Javascript support is experimental and will not be updated as frequently as the Python one. Follow [@promptlayer](https://twitter.com/promptlayer) for updates and check back here for Javascript requirements.</Warning>

## LangChain for Javascript

PromptLayer is available through LangChain’s Javascript library: [https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs)

Learn more at: [https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/models/llms/integrations#promptlayeropenai](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/models/llms/integrations#promptlayeropenai)

## Using without LangChain

To get started, create an account by clicking “*Log in*” on [PromptLayer](https://promptlayer.com/). Once logged in, click the button to create an API key and save this in a secure location.

We do not have an `npm` library yet, but in the meantime we have a wrapper function to our API. You can find it in our github repo under [MagnivOrg/promptlayer-js-helper](https://github.com/MagnivOrg/promptlayer-js-helper)
