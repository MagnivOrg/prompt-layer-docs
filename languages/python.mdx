To get started, create an account by clicking ‚Äú*Log in*‚Äù on [PromptLayer](https://promptlayer.com/). Once logged in, click the button to create an API key and save this in a secure location ([Guide to Using Env Vars](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-quick-guide-to-using-environment-variables-in-python-d4ec9291619e)).

Once you have that all set up, [install PromptLayer using](https://pypi.org/project/promptlayer/) `pip`.

```bash
pip install promptlayer
```

PromptLayer python library has support for both OpenAI and Anthropic LLMs!

## OpenAI

In the Python file where you use OpenAI APIs, add the following. This allows us to keep track of your requests without needing any other code changes.

<CodeGroup>

```python openai >= 1.0.0
import promptlayer
promptlayer.api_key = "<YOUR PromptLayer API KEY pl_xxxxxx>"
OpenAI = promptlayer.openai.OpenAI
```

```python openai < 1.0.0
import promptlayer
promptlayer.api_key = "<YOUR PromptLayer API KEY pl_xxxxxx>"
openai = promptlayer.openai
```

</CodeGroup>

**You can then use `openai` as you would if you had imported it directly.**

<Info>Your OpenAI API Key is **never** sent to our servers. All OpenAI requests are made locally from your machine, PromptLayer just logs the request.</Info>

There is only one difference‚Ä¶ PromptLayer allows you to add tags through the `pl_tags` argument. This allows you to track and group requests in the dashboard. 

************Tags are not required but we recommend them!************

```python
openai.Completion.create(
	engine="text-ada-001", 
	prompt="My name is", 
	pl_tags=["name-guessing", "pipeline-2"]
)
```

After making your first few requests, you should be able to see them in the PromptLayer dashboard!

Here is a complete code snippet:

```python
import promptlayer

# Swap out 'from openai import OpenAI'
OpenAI = promptlayer.openai.OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Compose a poem please."}
  ],
  pl_tags=["getting-started"]
)
print(completion.choices[0].message)
```

## Anthropic

Using Anthropic with PromptLayer is very similar to how to one would use OpenAI. 

Below is an example code snippet of the one line replacement:

```python
import promptlayer

# Swap out 'from openai import OpenAI'
OpenAI = promptlayer.openai.OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Compose a poem please."}
  ],
  pl_tags=["getting-started"]
)
print(completion.choices[0].message)
```

Here is how it would look like on the dashbaord:
