Right now, the best way to access PromptLayer is through our Python wrapper library that can be installed with `pip install promptlayer`.

Our REST API is fully supported, the Python library is simply a wrapper over it. 

## Overview

PromptLayer provides a powerful REST API that allows you to interact with the platform programmatically. The API enables you to perform various actions, such as tracking requests, getting prompt templates, publishing prompt templates, tracking scores, associating prompt templates with requests, and associating metadata with requests.
