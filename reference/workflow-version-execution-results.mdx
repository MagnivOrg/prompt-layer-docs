Retrieve the execution results of a specific Agent version. You can include all output nodes by setting the `all_outputs` query parameter to `true`.

Please note that this feature was previously called "Workflows" and is now called "Agents". Some references to "Workflows" remain in our SDK and will be updated before the feature exits beta.
