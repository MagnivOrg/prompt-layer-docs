### Authentication

This endpoint requires JWT or API key authentication.

### Filtering by Name

Use the `name` parameter to search for evaluations by name. The search is case-insensitive and matches partial names. This is useful for discovering existing evaluations programmatically.

### Filtering by Status

Use the `status` parameter to control which evaluations are returned based on their deletion status:
- `active` (default): Returns only active evaluations
- `deleted`: Returns only deleted/archived evaluations
- `all`: Returns both active and deleted evaluations
