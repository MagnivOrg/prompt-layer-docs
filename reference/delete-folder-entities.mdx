title: "Delete Folder Entities"
openapi: "DELETE /api/public/v2/folders/entities"
---

Deletes one or more entities from the workspace. Supports deleting folders, prompts, snippets, workflows, datasets, evaluations, AB tests, and input variable sets. Use `cascade=true` to recursively delete all contents of a folder. Without cascade, deleting a non-empty folder returns an error. Entities are soft-deleted where applicable.
