title: "Create Dataset Version from File"
openapi: "POST /api/public/v2/dataset-versions/from-file"
---

### Authentication

This endpoint requires API key authentication only.

### Asynchronous Processing

This endpoint initiates an asynchronous job to process the uploaded file. The actual dataset version creation happens in the background. A draft dataset (version_number = -1) is created immediately, and upon successful processing, it's assigned a proper version number.

### Webhooks

The following webhooks are triggered during the process:

- `dataset_version_created_by_file` - Sent when the dataset version is successfully created
- `dataset_version_created_by_file_failed` - Sent if the dataset creation fails

### Notes

- Maximum file size: 100MB
- Failed drafts are automatically cleaned up
