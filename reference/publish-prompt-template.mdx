title: "Publish Prompt Template (Deprecated)"
openapi: "POST /rest/publish-prompt-template"

Publish Prompt Template allows you to programmatically create a new version of a prompt. This endpoint works with the deprecated prompt template format. This was meant to be used alongside `promptlayer_client.prompts.get`. However, this function is deprecated. Use the `promptlayer_client.templates.publish` endpoint instead.
