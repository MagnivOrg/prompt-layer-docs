title: "Create Dataset Version from Request History"
openapi: "POST /api/public/v2/dataset-versions/from-filter-params"
---

Create a new dataset version by filtering existing request logs. The dataset is populated asynchronously based on the provided filter parameters.

### Authentication

This endpoint requires API key authentication only.

### Asynchronous Processing

This endpoint initiates an asynchronous job to process the request logs based on the filter parameters. The actual dataset version creation happens in the background. A draft dataset (version_number = -1) is created immediately.

### Webhooks

The following webhook is triggered when the process completes:

- `dataset_version_created_from_filter_params` - Sent when the dataset version is successfully created, includes:
  - `dataset_id`: ID of the created dataset
  - `rows_added`: Number of rows added to the dataset
  - `dataset_version_number`: Final version number assigned

### Notes

- If an existing draft dataset exists for the dataset group, it will be updated with new filter params
- If no matching request logs are found, an empty dataset version is created
- Failed drafts are automatically cleaned up
