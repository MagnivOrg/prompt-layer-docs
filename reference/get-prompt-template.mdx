Get Prompt Template allows you to get the template for a prompt based on the name. If the template is found, it will send you back a json object that includes some metadata (including the `id`, which can be used as the `prompt_id` in `log-request`) and the `prompt-template` itself which is a JSON representation of your prompt [following the langchain format.](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/prompts/examples/prompt_serialization.html#loading-from-json)
