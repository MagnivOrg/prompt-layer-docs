The Prompt Registry allows you to easily manage your prompt templates, which are customizable prompt strings with placeholders for variables. 

Specifically, a prompt template is your prompt string with variables indicated in curly brackets (`This is a prompt by {author_name}`). Prompt templates can have tags and are uniquely named.

You can use this tool to programmatically retrieve and publish prompts (even at runtime!). That is, this registry makes it easy to start A/B testing your prompts. Viewed as a "**Prompt Management System**”, this registry allows your org to pull out and organize the prompts that are currently dispersed throughout your codebase.

## Collaboration

The Prompt Registry is perfect for engineering teams looking to organize & track their many prompt templates.

... but the **real** power of the registry is collaboration. Engineering teams waste cycles deploying prompts and content teams are often blocked waiting on these deploys.

 By programmatically pulling down prompt templates at runtime, product and content teams can visually update & deploy prompt templates without waiting on eng deploys. 
 
 We know quick feedback loops are important, but the Prompt Registry also makes those annoying last-minute prompt updates easy.

## Getting a Template

The Prompt Registry is designed to be used at runtime to pull the latest prompt template for your request.

It’s simple.

```python Python SDK
template_dict = promptlayer.prompts.get("my_template")
```

Alternatively, use the REST API endpoint `/rest/get-prompt-template` ([read more](/reference/get-prompt-template)).

You can also optionally pass `version` to get an older version of a prompt. By default the newest version of a prompt is returned

```python Python SDK
template_dict = promptlayer.prompts.get("my_template", version=3)
```

Optionally, to return a Langchain `PromptTemplate` type include **************langchain=True************** as an optional argument as shown below.

```python Python SDK
prompt_template_obj = promptlayer.prompts.get("my_template", langchain=True)
```

## Publishing a Template

You can use the UI or API to create a template. 

Templates are unique by name, which means that publishing a template with the same name will overwrite old templates.

### Visually

To create a template using the UI, simply navigate to the Registry and click "Create Template". This will allow you to create the template visually. You can also edit old templates from the UI.

Rename a template by triple-clicking on its name. It’s best practice to keep template names unique and lowercase.

### Programmatically

While it's easiest to publish prompt templates visually through the dashboard, some users prefer the programatic interface detailed below.

```python Python SDK
promptlayer.prompts.publish(
    "my_template", prompt_template=my_template, tags=["my_tag"])
```

Alternatively, use the REST API endpoint `/rest/publish-prompt-template` ([read more](/reference/publish-prompt-template)).

You can also use Langchain to create a template, either by pulling it from LangchainHub, creating a custom template, or providing a Python dictionary directly.

## Tracking templates

The power of the Prompt Registry comes from associating requests with the template they used. This allows you to track average score, latency, and cost of each prompt template. You can also see the individual requests using the template.

To associate a request with a prompt template and some input variables, use the code below with the [pl_request_id](/features/prompt-history/request-id) for the request.

```python Python SDK
promptlayer.track.prompt(request_id=pl_request_id, 
    prompt_name='<PROMPT_NAME>', prompt_input_variables={...})
```

Alternatively, use the REST API endpoint `/rest/track-prompt` ([read more](/reference/track-prompt)).

## A/B Testing

The Prompt Registry allows you to manage and publish prompt templates programmatically, which makes it easier to separate prompts from the codebase and to perform A/B testing. 

CMS systems like the Prompt Registry are useful for A/B testing because they allow you to programmatically manage and publish different versions of a prompt template. By creating multiple versions of a prompt template, you can serve different prompts to different users and measure which version performs better. This can help you optimize your prompts and improve user engagement.
