## Creating Custom Models

Once your provider is configured, you can define models for it:

3. Fill in the model configuration:

   - **Provider**: Select the custom provider you created earlier

   - **Display Name**: A friendly name that appears in the prompt playground
   - **Model Type**: Specify whether this is a Chat or Completion model

## Using Custom Models

After setup, your custom models seamlessly integrate with PromptLayer's features. You can:

- Select them in the Playground alongside standard models
- Use them in the Prompt Editor for template creation
- Track requests and analyze performance just like any other model

Custom providers give you complete control over your model infrastructure while maintaining all the benefits of PromptLayer's prompt management and observability features.
