[Exa](https://exa.ai/) provides AI-powered web search and research models that can be integrated with PromptLayer through custom providers. Exa's models excel at finding relevant information, generating research reports, and providing cited answers from web sources.

## Setting Up Exa as a Custom Provider

To use Exa models in PromptLayer:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Custom Providers and Models** in your PromptLayer dashboard
2. Click **Create Custom Provider**
3. Configure the provider with the following details:
   - **Name**: Exa (or your preferred name)
   - **Client**: OpenAI
   - **Base URL**: `https://api.exa.ai`
   - **API Key**: Your Exa API key (get one at [exa.ai](https://exa.ai))

<Note>
Exa uses OpenAI-compatible endpoints, which is why we select OpenAI as the client type.
</Note>

## Creating Custom Models (Recommended)

For easier model selection in the Playground and Prompt Registry, you can create custom models:

1. In **Settings → Custom Providers and Models**, find your Exa provider in the list
2. Click on the Exa row to expand it
3. Click **Create Custom Model**
4. Configure each model:
   - **Provider**: Select the Exa provider you created
   - **Model Name**: Enter the Exa model identifier (e.g., `exa`, `exa-research`)
   - **Display Name**: A friendly name like "Exa Answer" or "Exa Research"
   - **Model Type**: Chat
5. Repeat for each model you want to use

This allows you to select Exa models directly from the dropdown instead of typing them manually.

Exa regularly updates their model offerings. Example models include:

- **`exa`**: Fast answer generation with web search
- **`exa-research`**: In-depth research with comprehensive citations
- **`exa-research-pro`**: Advanced research capabilities

### In the Prompt Registry

Exa models work seamlessly with PromptLayer's Prompt Registry:

- Select Exa models when creating or editing prompt templates
- Use templates with Exa models in evaluations
- Track and analyze Exa API usage alongside other providers

### Key Features

Exa models in PromptLayer support:

- **Citations**: Exa responses include source citations for research and fact-checking
- **Research Capabilities**: Deep web search for comprehensive answers
- **Web Search Integration**: Real-time access to current web information

## SDK Usage

You can also use Exa models programmatically with the PromptLayer SDK:

```python
from promptlayer import PromptLayer

promptlayer = PromptLayer(api_key="pl_****")

# Use Exa through custom provider
OpenAI = promptlayer.openai.OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.exa.ai",
    api_key="your_exa_api_key"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="exa-research",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What are the latest developments in AI safety?"}
    ]
)

# Exa returns multiple choices - the final answer is in the last choice
final_response = [choice for choice in response.choices if choice.finish_reason == "stop"][0]
print(final_response.message.content)
```

<Info>
Because Exa uses OpenAI-compatible endpoints, you can use it with any PromptLayer feature that supports OpenAI, including streaming, prompt templates, and `pl.run()`.
