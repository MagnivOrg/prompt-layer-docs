## I'm having trouble with the LangChain integration.

Try updating both LangChain and PromptLayer to their most recent versions.

## Do you support OpenAI function calling?

Yes, we take great pride in staying up to date. PromptLayer is 1-to-1 with OpenAI's library. That means, if you are using PromptLayer+OpenAI through the Python libraries, [function calling](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates) will be implicitly supported.

If you are using our REST library, [track-request](/reference/track-request) mirrors OpenAI's request schema. You can add `functions` into `kwargs` and use function-type messages as you would use normal messages in `gpt-4`.
