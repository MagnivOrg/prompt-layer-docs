### Prompt Template

The _Prompt Template_ evaluation type allows you to execute a prompt template from the Prompt Registry. You have the flexibility to select the latest version, a specific label, or a particular version of the prompt template. You also have the ability to assign the input variables based on available inputs from the dataset or other columns. You can override the model parameters that are set in the Prompt Registry. This functionality is particularly useful for testing a prompt template within a larger evaluation pipeline, comparing different model parameters, or implementing an "LLM as a judge" prompt template.

### Custom API Endpoint

The _Custom API Endpoint_ enables you to set up a webhook that our system will call (POST) with all the columns to the left of the API endpoint when that cell is executed. As cells are processed sequentially, we will call this endpoint with all the columns to the left as the given payload, and the returned result will be displayed. This feature allows for extensive customization to accommodate specific use cases and integrate with external systems or custom evaluators.

The payload will be in the form of 
    
    ```json
        {
            data: {
                "column1": "value1",
                "column2": "value2",
                "column3": "value3",
                ...
            }
        }
    ```

### MCP

The _MCP Action_ allows you to run functions on a remote MCP server. Simply plug in your server URL and auth, select your function and you will be able to call your function with inputs mapped from other cells. For more information about MCP check out [the official MCP docs.](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)

### Human Input

The _Human Input_ evaluation type allows the addition of either numeric or text input where an evaluator can provide feedback via a slider or a text box. This input can then be utilized in subsequent columns in the evaluation pipeline, allowing for the incorporation of human judgment.

### Code Execution

The _Code Execution_ evaluation type allows you to write and execute code for each row in your dataset. You can access the data through the `data` variable and return the cell value. Note that stdout will be ignored. There is a `6 minute timeout` for code execution.

Code example to return a list of the names of each column:

<CodeGroup>

```py Python
message = "These are my column names: "
columns = [column_name for column_name in data.keys()]
return message + str(columns)
```

```js JavaScript
const message = "These are my column names: ";
const columns = Object.keys(data);
return message + JSON.stringify(columns);
```

</CodeGroup>

```

### Conversation Simulator

The _Conversation Simulator_ evaluation type automates the back-and-forth between your AI agent and simulated users to test conversational AI performance. This is particularly useful for evaluating multi-turn conversations where context maintenance, goal achievement, and user interaction patterns are critical.

When setting up the conversation simulator:

* Select your AI agent prompt template from the Prompt Registry
* Pass in user details or context variables from your dataset
* Define a test persona that challenges your AI with specific behaviors or constraints

**Example Test Persona:**
```
User is nervous about seeing the doctor, hasn't been in a long time, 
won't share phone number until asked three times for it
```

**Optional Advanced Configuration:**

* **User Goes First**: By default, the AI agent initiates the conversation. You can enable this setting to have the simulated user start the conversation instead.

* **Conversation Samples**: You can provide sample conversations to help guide the simulated user's responses. These samples help maintain consistent voice and interaction patterns, ensuring the simulated user behaves realistically and consistently with your expected user base.

The conversation results are returned as a JSON list of messages that can then be evaluated using other eval types like LLM Assertions to assess success criteria.

## Simple Evals

### Equality Comparison

_Equality Comparison_ allows you to compare two different columns as strings. It provides a visual diff if there is a difference between the columns. Note that the diff is not used when calculating the score in that column and the column will be treated as a boolean for the purposes of a score. If there is no difference, it this column return true. 

### Contains Value

The _Contains_ evaluation type enables you to search for a substring within a column. For instance, you could search for a specific word or phrase within each cell in the column. It is using the python `in` operator to check if the substring is in the cell and is case insensitive.

### Regex Match

The _Regex Match_ evaluation type allows you to define a regular expression pattern to search within the column. This provides powerful pattern matching capabilities for complex text analysis tasks.

### Absolute Numeric Distance

The _Absolute Numeric Distance_ evaluation type allows you to select two different columns and output the absolute distance between their numeric values in a new column. Both source columns must contain numeric values.

## LLM Evals

### Run LLM Assertion

The _LLM Assertion_ evaluation type enables you to run an assertion on a column using natural language prompts. You can create prompts such as "Does this contain an API key?", "Is this sensitive content?", or "Is this in English?". Our system uses a backend prompt template that processes your assertion and returns either true or false. Assertions should be framed as questions.

### Cosine Similarity

_Cosine Similarity_ allows you to compare the vector distance between two columns. The system takes the two columns you supply, converts them into strings, and then embeds them using OpenAI's embedding vectors. It then calculates the cosine similarity, resulting in a number between 0 and 1. This metric is useful for understanding how semantically similar two bodies of text are, which can be valuable in assessing topic adherence or content similarity.

## Helper Functions

### JSON Extraction

The _JSON Extraction_ evaluation type allows you to define a JSON path and extract either the first match or all matches in that path. We will automatically cast the source column into a JSON object. This is particularly useful for parsing structured data within your evaluations.

### Parse Value

The _Parse Value_ column type enables you to convert another column into one of the following value types: string, number, Boolean, or JSON.

### Static Value

The _Static Value_ evaluation type allows you to pre-populate a column with a specific value. This is useful for adding constant values or context that you may need to use later in one of the other columns in your evaluation pipeline.

### Type Validation

_Type Validation_ returns a boolean for the given source column if it fits one of the specified types. The types supported for validation are JSON, number, or SQL. It will return `true` if the value is valid for the specified type, and `false` otherwise. For SQL validation, the system utilizes the [SQLGlot library](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot?tab=readme-ov-file#parser-errors).

### Coalesce

The _Coalesce_ evaluation type allows you to take multiple different columns and coalesce them, similar to [SQL's COALESCE function](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_sqlserver_coalesce.asp).

### Count

The _Count_ evaluation type allows you to select a source column and count either the characters, words, or paragraphs within it. This will output a numeric value, which can be useful for analyzing the length or complexity of LLM outputs.

### AI Data Extract

The _AI Data Extract_ evaluation type uses AI/LLM to extract specific information from data sources. You can describe what you want to extract using natural language queries, making it accessible for both technical and non-technical users.

When setting up AI Data Extract:
* Select a source column containing the data to extract from
* Write a natural language query describing what information to extract

Example queries:
* "Extract the product name"
* "Find the customer's email address"
* "Get all mentioned dates"
* "Extract the total price including tax"

This evaluation type is particularly useful for:
* Extracting structured data from unstructured text
* Parsing specific fields from documents
* Finding and extracting information based on semantic understanding rather than pattern matching

### Apply Diff

The _Apply Diff_ evaluation type applies diff patches to original content, similar to git merge operations. This helper function requires two source columns: the original content and a diff patch to apply.

When configuring Apply Diff:
* Select the first source column containing the original content
* Select the second source column containing the diff patch

Use cases include:
* Applying code changes from diff patches
* Merging text modifications
* Processing incremental updates to content
* Version control-like operations on text/code

This evaluation type is particularly powerful when combined with code generation workflows or document editing pipelines where AI agents generate incremental changes rather than complete replacements. It enables sophisticated multi-step workflows where agents can review and refine each other's outputs.
