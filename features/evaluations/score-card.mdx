Score cards in PromptLayer provide a powerful way to automatically calculate and track evaluation scores for your pipelines. Scores are calculated automatically when an evaluation completes, giving you immediate insights into your prompt performance.

## How Scoring Works

When an evaluation pipeline finishes running, PromptLayer automatically calculates a score based on the results. There are two types of scoring methods available:

### Simple Scores

Simple scores are the default scoring method. They automatically aggregate results from selected columns in your pipeline.

**How Simple Scoring Works:**

1. **Column Selection**: By default, the last column in your pipeline is used for scoring. You can select specific columns to include in the score calculation.

2. **Value Aggregation**: For each scoring column, the system:
   - Collects all completed cell values
   - Converts values to booleans (for true/false assertions) or numbers
   - Calculates the mean of all values

3. **Score Types**:
   - **Boolean scores**: Displayed as a percentage (0-100%) representing the ratio of true values
   - **Numeric scores**: Displayed as the average of all numeric values

4. **Final Score**: If multiple columns are selected for scoring, the final score is the mean of all column scores. You will see a breakdown of each column's contribution to the overall score.

### Matrix Scores

Matrix scores provide advanced scoring capabilities using custom code. This allows you to implement complex scoring logic, weighted averages, or custom business rules.

**How Matrix Scoring Works:**

1. **Custom Code Execution**: You provide Python (or JavaScript) code that receives all evaluation data
2. **Data Access**: Your code receives a `data` variable containing all row results
3. **Score Calculation**: Your code must return:
   - A `score` key with a numeric value (required)
   - Optionally, a `score_matrix` for detailed scoring breakdowns. You can provide multiple matrices if needed

### Updating a Score on a Report

By default scores are inhereted on a pipline. However, you can update the score calculation on an existing report by editing the report settings. Changes to scoring will automatically recalculate the score based on the new configuration.
