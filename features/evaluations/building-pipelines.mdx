1. **Select Your Datasets**: Choose or upload datasets to serve as the basis for your evaluations, whether for scoring, regression testing, or bulk job processing.
2. **Build Your Pipeline**: Start by visually constructing your evaluation pipeline, defining each step from input data processing to final evaluation.
3. **Run Evaluations**: Execute your pipeline, observe the results in a spreadsheet-like interface, and make informed decisions based on comprehensive metrics and scores.

### Creating a Batch Run

1. **Initiate a Batch Run**: Start by creating a new batch run, which requires specifying a name and selecting a dataset.
2. **Dataset Selection**: Choose from existing dataset formats (JSON or CSV), or create a dataset from historical data using filters like time range, prompt template logs, scores, and metadata.

#### Preview Mode

- Enter preview mode after dataset selection to iterate with live feedback, allowing for adjustments in real-time.

### Building Your Evaluation Pipeline

#### Adding Columns

- **Add Columns**: Click 'Add Column' to start building your pipeline, with each column representing a step in the evaluation process.

#### Column Types

- **Prompt Template**: Select a prompt template from the registry, set model parameters, LLM, arguments, and template version.
- **Custom API Endpoint**: Define a URL to send and receive data, suitable for custom evaluators or external systems.
- **Human Input**: Engage human graders by adding a column that allows for textual input.
- **String Comparison**: Employ this column to compare the outputs of two different columns, highlighting variances.

### Executing Full Batch Runs

- Transition from preview to full batch run to apply your pipeline across the entire dataset for comprehensive evaluation.

#### Scoring

If the last column (or step) of your evaluation pipeline contains all booleans or numeric values, that will be consider the score for the row. Your full evaluation report will have a scorecard of the average of this last column.

_NOTE: All cells in the last column must be boolean or all must be numeric. If any cell deviates, the score will not be calculated_
