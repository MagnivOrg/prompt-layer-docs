[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) provides access to a wide variety of cutting-edge models through a unified API, including models like DeepSeek, Claude, GPT-4, and many others that may not be available through standard providers.

## Setting Up OpenRouter as a Custom Provider

To use OpenRouter models in PromptLayer:

1. **Get an OpenRouter API Key**: Sign up at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) and obtain your API key from their dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings → Custom Providers and Models** in your PromptLayer dashboard
3. Click **Create Custom Provider**
4. Configure the provider with the following details:
   - **Name**: OpenRouter
   - **Client**: OpenAI (OpenRouter uses OpenAI-compatible endpoints)
   - **Base URL**: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`
   - **API Key**: Your OpenRouter API key

## Creating Custom Models (Recommended)

For easier model selection in the Playground and Prompt Registry, you can save specific OpenRouter models:

1. In **Settings → Custom Providers and Models**, find your OpenRouter provider in the list
2. Click on the OpenRouter row to expand it
3. Click **Create Custom Model** in the expanded section
4. Configure each model:
   - **Model Name**: Enter the OpenRouter model identifier (e.g., `deepseek/deepseek-chat`, `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`)
   - **Display Name**: A friendly name like "DeepSeek Chat" or "Claude 3.5 Sonnet"
   - **Model Type**: Chat
5. Repeat for each model you want to use

The full list of available models can be found in [OpenRouter's documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/overview/models).

## Using OpenRouter in PromptLayer

### In the Playground

After setup, you can use OpenRouter models in the PromptLayer Playground:

1. Open the Playground
2. Select your OpenRouter provider from the provider dropdown
3. Choose your desired model (or type the model identifier)
4. Start querying with your prompts

### In the Prompt Registry

OpenRouter models work seamlessly with PromptLayer's Prompt Registry:

- Select OpenRouter models when creating or editing prompt templates
- Use templates with OpenRouter models in evaluations
- Track and analyze OpenRouter API usage alongside other providers

### Key Benefits

OpenRouter provides:

- **Wide Model Selection**: Access to models from multiple providers through one API
- **Automatic Rate Limiting and Failover**: OpenRouter handles rate limiting between providers
- **Cost Optimization**: Compare pricing across different models and providers
- **Model Availability**: Access to models that might not be directly available in your region

## SDK Usage

Once you've set up your OpenRouter custom provider and created a prompt template in the dashboard, you can run it programmatically with the PromptLayer SDK:

```python
from promptlayer import PromptLayer

promptlayer = PromptLayer(api_key="pl_****")

# Run a prompt template that uses your OpenRouter custom provider
response = promptlayer.run(
    prompt_name="your-openrouter-prompt",
    input_variables={"query": "your input"}
)

# Access the response
print(response["raw_response"].choices[0].message.content)

# The request is automatically logged with request_id
print(f"Request ID: {response['request_id']}")
```

<Info>
Using [`promptlayer.run()`](/running-requests/promptlayer-run) ensures your requests are properly logged to PromptLayer and leverages your prompt templates from the Prompt Registry. This is the recommended approach for production use.
