Every PromptLayer request can be given an integer score 0-100.

To associate a score with a prompt, you can either do this visually from the dashboard or programmatically.
By default, an individual score is named default. You can enrich a request with multiple scores using "named scores" as shown below.

```python Python
# named score
promptlayer.track.score(
  request_id=pl_request_id, 
  name="summarization",
  score=100
)

# default score
promptlayer.track.score(
  request_id=pl_request_id, 
  # name="default",
  score=100
)
```

```bash REST
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.promptlayer.com/rest/track-score \
