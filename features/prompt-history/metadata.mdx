PromptLayer allows you to attach multiple key value pairs as metadata to a request. In the dashboard, you can look up requests and analyze analytics using metadata.

We recommend using this for things like session IDs, user IDs, or error messages. Metadata is useful to help you use the [advanced search](/why-promptlayer/advanced-search) or understand the Analytics page.

```python
promptlayer.track.metadata(
  request_id=pl_request_id,
  metadata={
      "user_id":"1abf2345f",
      "post_id": "2cef2345f"
  }
)
```

Things to note:

1. Currently keys and values need to be strings in PromptLayer.
2. If you track a key that was already tracked before for a specific request_id, the value that corresponds to that key will be replaced.
