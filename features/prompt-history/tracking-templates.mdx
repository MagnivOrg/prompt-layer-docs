PromptLayer allows you to track prompt template usage, latency, cost, and more. This is done by associating a request with a prompt template as shown below.

To associate requests with a prompt from the prompt registry, run the following line

```python
promptlayer.track.prompt(
  request_id=pl_request_id, 
  prompt_name="example-2",
  prompt_input_variables=input_variables,
  version=2
)
```

Where `prompt_name` is a prompt in your prompt registry, `prompt_input_variables` is a dictionary corresponding to the input variables you formatted the prompt with, and `version` is the version of the prompt you are trying to track. `version` is optional, by default it will track the newest version of the prompt.

This information will appear on your dashboard under your request and prompt template pages.
