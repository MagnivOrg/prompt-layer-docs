PromptLayer is a devtool that allows you to track, manage, and share your prompt engineering. It provides a platform for versioning prompts, executing them against any LLM provider, and logging all requests with rich metadata for easy exploration and search in the PromptLayer dashboard.

## **How it Works**

PromptLayer provides two primary ways to integrate with your application:

1. **The `run()` method** — Fetch a prompt template from the Prompt Registry, execute it against your configured LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.), and automatically log the result. This is the recommended approach.
2. **The `log_request` method / REST API** — Make LLM requests with your own client code and log them to PromptLayer for tracking and analysis.

All LLM requests are made locally from your machine — your API keys are never sent to PromptLayer servers. PromptLayer simply manages your prompt templates and logs the requests.

## **Features**

Some of the key features of PromptLayer include:

- **Prompt Registry:** Version, manage, and retrieve prompt templates through a visual editor and API.
- **API request logging:** PromptLayer records all your LLM requests, allowing you to search and explore request history in the PromptLayer dashboard.
- **Metadata tracking:** PromptLayer logs each LLM request with metadata such as the prompt used, the response returned, tags, scores, and any additional parameters.
- **Easy integration:** Use the `run()` method for zero-setup integration, or `log_request` to add logging to your existing code.
- **Designed for production:** PromptLayer is designed to help maintain LLMs in production and aid in the development process. It is prod-ready and will not interfere with your application's functionality even if it fails.
- **Collaboration:** PromptLayer allows you to share your prompt engineering with others, making it easy to collaborate on projects with teammates or share your work with the wider community.

## **Getting Started**

To get started with PromptLayer, you will need to sign up for an account on the PromptLayer website. Once you have created an account, install the SDK and start using the `run()` method to execute prompts or `log_request` to log your existing LLM calls.

All your requests will be logged and saved to the cloud. You can access this data via the PromptLayer dashboard, which allows you to search and explore your request history, view metadata, and collaborate with others.
