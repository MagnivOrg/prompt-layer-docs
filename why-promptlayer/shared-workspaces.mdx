# Overview

The Organizations & Workspaces feature in PromptLayer provides a comprehensive system for team collaboration and resource management. Organizations serve as the top-level container for your company, while workspaces allow you to organize projects, teams, and resources within your organization.

## Key Features

- **Organization Management**: Centralized control over your entire company's PromptLayer usage
- **Workspace Organization**: Create multiple workspaces for different teams, projects, or environments
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Manage permissions at both organization and workspace levels
- **Resource Sharing**: Share prompts, evaluations, and other resources across your team
- **Billing Management**: Consolidated billing and usage tracking at the organization level

## Organizations

### What is an Organization?

An organization represents your company or top-level entity in PromptLayer. It provides:
- Centralized billing and subscription management
- User management across all workspaces
- Organization-wide settings and configurations
- Usage tracking and analytics

### Organization Roles

Organizations support different user roles:
- **Owner**: Full administrative access, billing management, and ability to manage all workspaces
- **Admin**: Can manage users, create workspaces, and access all workspace data
- **Member**: Default role with access to assigned workspaces

### Managing Your Organization

To access organization settings:
1. Click on your organization name in the top navigation
2. Select "Organization Settings" from the dropdown
3. From here you can:
   - Manage organization members
   - View billing and subscription details
   - Configure organization-wide settings
   - Monitor usage across all workspaces

## Workspaces

### What is a Workspace?

Workspaces are collaborative environments within your organization where teams can:
- Share prompt templates and evaluations
- Collaborate on projects
- Organize resources by team or project
- Maintain separate environments (dev, staging, production)

### Creating a Workspace

You can create a new workspace by clicking the 'Create Workspace' button from the workspace dropdown.

Choose a unique name for your workspace to enhance its identity and ease of recognition among team members.

### Workspace Management

Upon creating a workspace, you'll be designated as the workspace administrator. This role empowers you to:
- Invite new members to the workspace
- Manage member permissions
- Remove members from the workspace
- Configure workspace-specific settings
- Delete the workspace if needed

### Workspace Roles and Permissions

Each workspace supports granular permission control:
- **Workspace Admin**: Full control over workspace settings and members
- **Editor**: Can create, edit, and delete resources within the workspace
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to workspace resources

## Best Practices

### Organization Structure

1. **By Team**: Create workspaces for each team (e.g., Engineering, Data Science, Product)
2. **By Project**: Separate workspaces for different projects or products
3. **By Environment**: Maintain separate workspaces for development, staging, and production

### Access Management

- Regularly review workspace memberships
- Use the principle of least privilege when assigning roles
- Remove access promptly when team members change roles or leave

### Resource Organization

- Use consistent naming conventions across workspaces
- Document workspace purposes and ownership
- Regularly archive or clean up unused workspaces

## Migration and Setup

### For New Users

1. Your first organization is created automatically when you sign up
2. Create your first workspace for your initial project
3. Invite team members as needed

### For Existing Users

If you're upgrading from a personal account:
1. Your existing resources will be migrated to a default workspace
2. You can create additional workspaces to better organize your resources
3. Invite team members to collaborate

## Billing and Limits

- Billing is managed at the organization level
- Workspace limits depend on your subscription plan
- Usage is tracked across all workspaces in your organization
- Contact support for enterprise plans with unlimited workspaces
