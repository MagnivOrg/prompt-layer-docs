**We believe that prompt management is a critical component of building successful AI products with Large Language Models (LLMs).** The Prompt Registry is designed to help you decouple prompts from code, enable collaboration among technical and non-technical stakeholders, and streamline the prompt development lifecycle.

Inspired by software engineering best practices, we offer a Prompt Registry that allows users to store, version, and organize prompts outside of their codebase. Whether you're a developer, product manager, QA tester, or subject-matter expert, the Prompt Registry provides simple tools needed to effectively manage and collaborate on prompts. Made for both engineers and non-technical prompt engineers.

For an in-depth look at the evolution of prompt management, from hard-coded prompts to a dedicated Prompt Management Tool like PromptLayer, check out this insightful blog post by Greg Baugues: [Make it easy to iterate on your prompts](https://haihai.ai/friction).

In this post, Greg shares his experience building LLM-based apps and how the approach to prompt management has evolved over time. He discusses the challenges of having prompts intermingled with code and the benefits of using a Prompt Management Tool to reduce friction in prompt iteration, enabling faster experimentation and collaboration.

## Prompt Management

The key to writing good prompts is to build a dev environment that let's your team prompt engineer quickly and systematically. A CMS is the way to do this.

### Key Features

- **Decoupling Prompts from Code**: Store prompts in the Prompt Registry CMS, separate from your codebase, allowing for faster iterations and more stakeholder collaboration.

- **Modular Design**: Create reusable prompt snippets and organize prompts into folders to promote modular design and better organization.

- **Collaboration Strategies**: Set up access controls and freeze versions to ensure that the right people have the right access at the right time, delineating production from development environments.

- **Descriptive Commit Messages**: Automatically track changes and use descriptive commit messages for each prompt version.

- **Programmatic Access**: Pull prompts programmatically at runtime using the PromptLayer API, keeping your codebase clean and maintainable.

### Benefits

- **Faster Iterations**: Decouple prompt development from regular engineering releases, enabling faster iteration cycles.

- **Inclusive Collaboration**: Involve non-technical stakeholders like PMs, QA testers, and subject-matter experts in the prompt development process.

- **Organized Prompt Library**: Maintain a tidy and organized prompt library with folders, snippets, and versioning.

- **Controlled Access**: Ensure the right people have the right access at the right time with granular access controls and version freezing.
