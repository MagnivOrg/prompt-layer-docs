The Playground is a native way to create and run new LLM requests all through PromptLayer. Your run history will be tracked in the sidebar. The Playground is most useful as a tool to "replay" and debug old requests.

## Replay requests

The Playground allows PromptLayer users to rerun previous LLM requests. Simply click "Open in Playground" on any historical request.

## OpenAI Tools

The Playground fully supports [OpenAI function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling). These tools can be accessed directly from the Playground interface and can be incorporated into your requests as needed. *Not even OpenAI's playground does this ðŸ‘€*

## Custom models

The Playground also supports the use of custom models for LLM requests. This means you can use a fine-tuned model or a dedicated OpenAI instance.
