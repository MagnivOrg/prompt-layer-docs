The `run_workflow()` method initiates the execution of predefined workflows in PromptLayer, allowing you to start complex, multi-step sequences. For a comprehensive understanding of workflows, including their use cases, key concepts, and versioning, please refer to the [Workflows documentation](/why-promptlayer/workflows).

## Basic Usage

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from promptlayer import PromptLayer

pl = PromptLayer(api_key="your_api_key")

response = pl.run_workflow(
    workflow_name="Your Workflow Name",
    workflow_version=1
)

print(response)
```

```js JavaScript
import { PromptLayer } from "promptlayer";

const pl = new PromptLayer({ apiKey: "your_api_key" });

const response = await pl.runWorkflow({
  workflowName: "Your Workflow Name",
  workflowVersion: 1
});

console.log(response);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Parameters

- `workflow_name` / `workflowName` (str, required): The name of the workflow to run.
- `input_variables` / `inputVariables` (Dict[str, Any], optional): Variables to be used in the workflow.
- `metadata` (Dict[str, str], optional): Additional metadata for the workflow run.
- `workflow_label_name` / `workflowLabelName` (str, optional): Label name for the workflow version.
- `workflow_version` / `workflowVersion` (int, optional): Specific version number of the workflow to run.

## Return Value

The method returns a dictionary (Python) or object (JavaScript) containing information about the initiated workflow execution:

- `success` (bool): Indicates if the workflow execution was successfully initiated.
- `message` (str): A message confirming the execution creation.
- `workflow_version_execution_id` (int): Unique identifier for the workflow execution.

Example response:
```python
{
    'message': 'Workflow execution created successfully',
    'success': True,
    'workflow_version_execution_id': 115
}
```

## Important Note

This method only initiates the workflow execution. The actual workflow may take time to complete. To retrieve the results once the workflow has finished, you need to use a separate API endpoint. For details on how to fetch the workflow execution results, including the required parameters and response format, please refer to the [Get Workflow Version Execution Results](/reference/workflow-version-execution-results) API documentation.

## Advanced Usage

### Using Input Variables

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
response = pl.run_workflow(
    workflow_name="Data Analysis Workflow",
    input_variables={"dataset_url": "https://example.com/data.csv"}
)
```

```js JavaScript
const response = await pl.runWorkflow({
  workflowName: "Data Analysis Workflow",
  inputVariables: { dataset_url: "https://example.com/data.csv" }
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### Adding Metadata

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
response = pl.run_workflow(
    workflow_name="Customer Service Workflow",
    metadata={"customer_id": "12345"}
)
```

```js JavaScript
const response = await pl.runWorkflow({
  workflowName: "Customer Service Workflow",
  metadata: { customer_id: "12345" }
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### Using Workflow Labels

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
response = pl.run_workflow(
    workflow_name="Marketing Campaign Workflow",
    workflow_label_name="production"
)
```

```js JavaScript
const response = await pl.runWorkflow({
  workflowName: "Marketing Campaign Workflow",
  workflowLabelName: "production"
});
```
